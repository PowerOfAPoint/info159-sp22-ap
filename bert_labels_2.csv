564.0,"I was gonna give this book 3 stars, but I decided on 2 because justifying attempted rape is never o.k. I felt like this book set out to be one of those deep, pretentious books that set out to give you life lessons. I will admit that it did a good job of not being pretentious. It was extremely emotionally manipulative, however."
93.0,"I liked it a lot, but it doesn't really stand alone; it's too much of a setup for what I assume are going to be Rose's later emotional discoveries. I'm very impressed by Rose, though, and would like to follow her further!"
563.0,"This book is all about female empowerment while also tackling many subjects such as racism, stereotyping, and sexuality. Seriously, it covers EVERYTHING. Feminism ftw. I like how it doesn't take itself too seriously though."
235.0,Short but a very nice introduction to the book series. I actually really quite enjoyed it a lot! I thought it was nice that the main character was gay and I like how the rest of the story is set up in this 'foundation'.
28.0,"I have read every Outlander novel multiple times, and this one I read the least. Not because it's not excellent, but because it rips my heart out EVERY SINGLE TIME! Oh, it could all bed the King, or make men cover with a single White Lady glare."
614.0,"** spoiler alert ** I equally loved book 2, and am definitely hooked. I did feel it took a little while for them to get to sea, but I guess we can't bring in a love interest if we aren't on the land! My favorite thing by far was the Lively, and the descriptions of how fast she is and how much care the crew took keeping her a crack ship. Pride in what you do can be a great motivator. I also loved how Jack made them work the guns against all the batteries for practice."
339.0,"A great example of a New Adult romance romance novel- filled with real and emotional story lines, tough situations, wonderful relationship, and new experiences."
627.0,"Original and refreshing, not to mention amazing. I love Marion's style of writing and I think I'm going to be eagerly awaiting ANY new book he writes. Even more stoked for the movie now. Beware of the explicit language in this book though. (Although the only cuss word that is constantly used in this book is the ""F"" word, it's used quite often.) Also, not gonna lie, there may have been oh, two or three parts (or 5+) that literally made me LOL and glad that I wasn't reading this in public... 5/5 (I would give it more stars if I could)."
553.0,Writing is all over the place. My first Megan Hart book. No clear point of view.
1.0,"I read this book before watching the movie (thank goodness, the movie was awful), and I enjoyed it immensely. The science and suspense were woven together in an exotic place to form a book that I look forward to reading again someday. I read it a long time ago, and though I can't remember details from it, I do recall being completely absorbed in it and left with some creepy imagery. I'm curious to see if it will be the same the second time around."
899.0,"April 17, 2014 : Wow that suspense update : April 12, 2014: After 2 years, I'm going to try this book again, now that the trilogy just ended a few days ago. I hope I'll like it more and maybe I'll also get into it. (Probably because I was 12 years old when I was trying to read this...too young.) this book wasn't my type of genre, i suppose ... i got bored, but it did seem interesting and i hope i'll try to read it again."
567.0,"This book was everything. I actually think I liked it a little more than the first one. (Only a little, because the first one was amazing, but still.) I never thought I would like this series as much as I do now. How these books manage to pack in so much action and create such great characters in the format that they do is incredible to me."
574.0,"4.5 stars, scorching hot sex scenes and great characters but the grammar took away from my enjoyment of the story."
531.0,"Considering most of the reviews I've seen about this book so far have been so-so, I really enjoyed it! I will say that I'm not at all a fan of scary movies and I tend to get scared very easily, so this may not be as exciting to hard core horror fans, but if you're like me and you want to dip your feet into the genre, I think this was great. Most people also didn't like the fact that the murderer gets revealed fairly early on, but the book didn't focus on who was commiting the crimes, but why they were commiting them, and I actually really enjoyed that aspect."
746.0,"Really excellent, I think this has been my favorite Shadowhunter Academy installment so far. It was very cute and brought in a lot of characters from The Mortal Instruments, which I always love to see. I think if you ship Malec you'll love this one"
623.0,"It has been a while since I read it so I have forgotten details, but I remember mostly liking it. I wondered if amnesia would alter a personality as much as shown, but the author did do research. And the fiance's getting to know the new woman is a sort of reminder that we do change and that we shouldn't assume details about another."
591.0,"This started off with a bang, absolutely hilarious! This series should probably be read in order and I will defintiely read the first book to see what all the fuss is about. Tapping Her is a super-quick, very dirty and very funny bit of romantic comedy, with some laugh-out-loud moments and a great male POV. There is nothing emotional or angsty about this book and it's just a little something to pick up in between heavier reads. Not too much of a plot here, so don't expect War and Peace."
552.0,"I am officially obsessed with Alexa Riley's books!! The Mechanic was a delicious, smutty, sizzling hot story with some of THE dirtiest talkers around. These books are like palate-cleansers in between the main course. Highly recommended!"
662.0,"Great book. A sci-fi classic. The fact that Gibson wrote this in 1984 is very impressive, as he makes many predictions that seem like they are coming true (was that a prediction?"
629.0,"I liked it but I was a bit disappointed. Probably because I came into this book with high expectations. I think I liked this book more than I would have if I hadn't been required to analyze and answer questions on it for English class. All the symbols, motifs, and themes probably would have flown over my head."
720.0,"3.5 stars. (I'm actually still unsure whether to rate this 3 or 4 stars but I'll just go with 4 for now, but honestly it really is 3.5) This book kind of dragged in the middle-end but other than that I was pretty invested. I mean, who isn't interested in romantic drama? Also, while I was reading this all I could think about is the fact that boys were just as much fuckboy-y in the early 19th century as they are today."
315.0,"Lincoln = <3 I love the way this story is told. I love every single character in it. I love the humor, the writing, the pop culture references, the struggles everybody is going through individually. Just. Awesome."
750.0,"I didn't know how much I needed this reread until I started reading this book again. Fangirl is just one of those books that understands you, and I'm so happy that I could read this book as a junior in high school and a junior in college and love it for the same and for different reasons."
533.0,"I honestly don't understand what people don't like about this book. I was expecting it to be terrible, espically because I find that I'm often not satisfied with the endings to series, but I loved every minute of this one. It was definitly creepier and more graphic, but I thought that it did a great job of explaining all of the shit that went down in the first two books. I honestly wasn't expecting to get that much closure. This was truly a spectacular series and a great ending to a great series."
520.0,"Loved every second, and didn't want it to end, so I had to find a book store and buy the next two! Its a Harry Potter reading level and similar type fantasy story, but sometimes thats what you need on a long flight to NYC for the holidays! I think as a child we all daydreamed about alternate worlds, so I love how thats the basis for the book. Thinking about all the permutations of how things could turn out differently is kinda fun :) I think if I had a Daemon I would hope she'd settle on being a lynx."
679.0,"LOVED THIS BOOK. LOVED the characters, and that the heroine is older. The ending is a little drawn out though. Still great book."
88.0,I love Uncle Stevie so I really gave this the old college try. I tried so hard to like it but a) the plot moves at a brutally sluggish pace and b) the way too large ensemble cast is composed of boring characters that are largely impossible to distinguish from each other.
383.0,Staggeringly pointless. I don't think I have ever read something with less content. There is absolutely nothing here.
755.0,"A delightful, highly readable stroll through the creation of the OED with some small asides to period London and surgeons in the Civil War. Good for leisurely summer reading."
690.0,Deeply troubling. Deeply moving. Moves inexorably to its end.
794.0,"I was really looking forward to this because I needed a good scare and it's been a long since I'd read a good horror novel. Maybe it's just me, but I wasn't frightened in the least. The story was not bad at all but I didn't really get what I wanted from this book."
561.0,"(This, and the whole series) Needs a re-read. This was my shit in middle school but all the hate has distorted my views of this book series (phenomena, really) and I need a refresh to form my own opinion. Thus, I've abstained from rating any books in this series until I reread them again. Back when I first read them, they all would have been 5 stars. After I thought it was ""cool"" to hate on this, they'd be 2 stars. The new rating will reflect my current opinion."
680.0,"Ok so I'll say it... At first I was a little unsure how I felt about the book, since Gemma kept going back and forth on her decision making.. It was kind of getting annoying. But.... That twist blew me away,( still not sure how I feel about it though) . So yes it's a must read simply because that twist was so not expected!"
816.0,"Deviant, dark and delicious!! I need more Fiona and Deacon as soon as possible. Full review to follow."
761.0,"A well written pot boiler with some interesting social commentary. The homeless former employees of the blue book factory was bittersweet. Well drawn main characters, who we all love to love and hate, in equal measure."
248.0,"I wish I could say this was the book that would make me die anticipating the next, but it isn't. Right now I'm rather glad I got it cheap. Even for urban fantasy it's plot was implausible, and the love triangle wasn't erotic, it was yucky. I'm of only one mind here---if a fourteen y/o is going to have sex in this series, it better damn well happen with another child--not a full-out man. I think I'll check out Burned when it's on the shelves...of my library."
903.0,3.5stars. Not as good as the first one until the middle end of the book but still good none the less. The ending is just as vague and infuriating though (although that could be me just being dramatic).
310.0,"I don't know what was about this book that made me like it so much. It isn't the best of Stephen King, it didn't impress me AT ALL, but after I finished, I keep missing Dev so much! I was unhappy for a while for wasn't be able to know about him anymore and sighing everytime I thought about him. I don't think this book is amazing, brilliant or anything like that, but the way it make me feel about Devin - even so long after I finished the book - deserve a five star rating."
194.0,"This is a perfect little book detailing the events of one summer from the perspective of 10-year-old Helen. She reminds me so much of myself at that age: clever, headstrong, and always so sure that she's right about everything. I enjoyed getting to know her and remember what it was like to be a girl just beginning to grow up."
686.0,"Although it is long, it was hard to find a place to put it down. Some very interesting characters, especially the women."
519.0,"This should be 3.5 stars. I really enjoyed it, but found it all kind of random and leading nowhere. That being said, it was very imaginative and entertaining. Hrun the Barbarian was one of my favorites, as was anything the Luggage did."
728.0,"...disappointed at all the hype this book had but I guess it just wasn't the book for me. If I had to describe it in one word, PRETENTIOUS. Also, it didn't help that halfway through the book I was extremely bored and I had to FORCE myself to finish it...maybe I'm missing something?"
760.0,"My three year old loved, LOVED, this book so much that afterwards we started role playing, with me as the Station Inspector and him as Hugo Cabret. Highly recommend."
303.0,"Pleasing and clever, especially with the use of the first-person to hide information, but probably not something I would have picked up on its own merits; what's been recommended to me is the series as a whole."
741.0,Loved this book. I'm just enjoying this whole world and these stories so much. There were so many brilliant and creative bits in this book that just really really made me appreciate Meyer as an author and a genius. I'm so excited to start Cress soon (and for more Thorne).
644.0,"I read this once in high school, and re-read it to my boys this year. It is wonderful--the pacing is good, the adventure unique and the main characters admirable (and loveable). We have now moved on to Fellowship of the Ring."
190.0,"I really ought to read this book again, but I have a very strong memory of flipping back through it after finishing the first time trying to figure out what the heck had just been going on. This book seemed to have several different stories in it, each following on from the previous one without resolving anything whatsoever from it, which just, I have to say, drove me nuts. They were all good and interesting stories, too, and I'd really like to know how they end! Maybe there's resolution in there that I just missed, but I'm not sure I could take the disappointment a second time if there isn't."
569.0,Everything we believe about pirates comes from this story. Yo-ho-ho! And Long John Silver is a character like no other--except perhaps the Devil himself in Paradise Lost. Rip-roaring adventure!
426.0,[image error] I am sorry but I felt like this book was all over the place and I was WTF ing the whole way through. I tried to like it but I just couldn't
224.0,It must be exhausting to have that much imagination to be able to write such a long story from so many different perspectives... and then to go on to write several other books equally as long and complicated. I loved it :)
693.0,I remember trying 3 times to read this but I always gave up on page 3 or so. So I skipped to book 2 and then read the whole series then came back to this book. It's hard to review this book without taking in the series a as a whole.
236.0,"Pretty good until now, I am still at the beginning though. But I like the way it is written and the characters are awesome!"
238.0,"thought this was the best short story by far - shorter than the others but much better in terms of character development, moving on the story and the messaging behind it all."
566.0,"Ending happened a little fast for me, but I loved the style and felt like the telling of the story was creative. Stylistically, one of the more interesting and engaging books I've read this year."
743.0,This was a fantastic (yet heartbreaking) conclusion to my favorite duology. Leigh Bardugo proves that you don't need very many books to write a captivating and well-structured series. The ending was bittersweet but still completely satisfying.
702.0,"*I originially rated this 2 stars, but thinking back on this book I can't remember anything about it except that it was pretty boring, so rating has been dropped to 1 stars* *Original Review* It was okay I guess. Hayley was pretty irritating and boy, was she BITTER. Finn was alright, he was one of those eccentric young adult male love interests (*cough* Augustus *cough*). I don't really know whether or not I actually ""liked"" this book or not..."
902.0,"I'm going to read this to finish up my dypstopian book challenge for 2013 but before I even open the book I'm going to predict, right now, that Ky is the person Cassia ends up with."
554.0,"Kristen did it again! The story of Frankie and Benny was just simply absolutely AMAZING!!! I could not put it down, so much so when finished I picked up the other burg books and started re-reading it to remember all the burg history. So if you haven't yet read it be sure to do sooo !!!"
665.0,One of my top 5 favorites. Read this at the deeper/figuring your life out moments - it will give you strength and inspiration.
26.0,I think I read a different book to everyone else. I was cringing every other sentence. I really enjoyed the first couple of books and then it just seemed to get away from the author. Perhaps I'm just getting older and more cynical with it. The ending just seemed way too easy. And I can't be bothered to say much else.
325.0,"It's hard for me to rate this book, because it's very clear when you come to the end that the second volume will be a continuation of the same story. Still, I will say that Valente is very clever (and sometimes maddening) in the way she has entwined all these stories together. I can't wait to start the second volume, but at the same time, I'm a little leery of going into the lion's den again!"
104.0,"It's hard to find a Gothic novel set in the very recent past that works, but this one fits the bill nicely. I want to go live in Black Rabbit Hall, as long as someone else pays for the repairs!"
234.0,Easy to read. Boring. Pretentious. Unrealistic. Left me unmoved and a little annoyed.
738.0,Completely loved the start to this series. It captivated me in a way that reminded me of when I first started the City of Bones series. I loved the characters and this magical world is like nothing I've ever read before. I can't wait to see where this story goes from here.
272.0,"This is just terrible all around. The plot is stupid, the characters are bland cliches, and the writing itself is colorless and dull."
456.0,"Meh. It's an interesting world, but the helplessness of the central female character grated."
2.0,"In a way I never expected it, this topped the first book. My eyes are so sore of crying now and my heart feels like it has been ripped from my chest. Lucien being my favorite in the first book has been replaced by Arziel and Cassian although I do have a lot of love for Rhys too. I just love my Illyrian boys. Although I am physically sore from reading this book, I haven't read such an awesome story in years. Definitely recommend this book to any and every YA reader"
785.0,"Great introduction of this world I've been a JLA fan for several years, but somehow never got around to reading this series. After this prequel I'm ready to dive in. I really loved Jas as a character and found her very relatable."
780.0,"What a heroine! I could not put this down! Distilled amorallity wrapped up in beauty, a desire for material goods. No, I guess things can not make you happy, but maybe you don't even care."
622.0,"A powerfully written story that will take your breath away. You will not be able to tear yourself away from the story of Sophie and Ian. The writing is flawless and the character development perfect. Unforgettable first-kiss scene! Seriously, this book needs to be made into a movie. Put this at the top of your to-read list for 2013."
914.0,"Eh. Took me about a month to read this. Honestly, I was sort of uninterested. It MIGHT have been because I'd just finish playing the Last of Us. Quite frankly, I think that the story works better in video game form."
29.0,"My second favorite of the epic series. Claire's adventures in in 17th century Scotland are lush and memorable. Yes, there is strife, witch hunts, and sadistic army captains, but there is love, too. Lots of it. Jamie Fraser is the stuff men should be made of."
499.0,"Enjoyed this, the culture is best enjoyed in its dealings with other societies. Certainly the books tend to be far more fun."
96.0,"I'm not quite sure what I expected from this book, but that wasn't it. I'm really impressed in a lot of ways with the protagonist of this book, and I think I'm going to be a while unpacking that into something that's more of a review, but there you go anyway. I'm awfully glad that there's not a long wait for the sequel."
667.0,"This might be the most deliciously dirty Alexa Riley story ever. I mean, look at the plot, ""stepdad"" and ""stepbrother"" want to f*k the teenager living with them in their trailer. But it's all very sweet and in good fun even though it is nasty and totally forbidden! If you have about 1/2 hour to spare, prepare yourself for a fun, filthy, sexy, erotic story. Loved it!"
460.0,"I read it online, at Subterranean Magazine, after I saw the Nebula nominees list had a link for it. Like most Ted Chiang stories, I need to think about it for a while to even know where to start pondering!"
779.0,"The same scene told from different view points, steam of consciousness writing, all linking together. Like an LSD trip--really takes you away. Read it late at night sipping a little something."
261.0,"There were many cool bits of writing in this book. However, despite some great scenes/situations I had problems with how the book was paced."
782.0,"This idiot is a true idiot, in the style of a sort of warmed over Jesus type, but incanting a sort of ""can't we all get along?"" refrain while pining over a girl of questionable morals (for the day) and plotting against a rival. Many funny moments, which keep it going."
