"I really liked this read.  After surviving a bus crash Knox decides to become successful so he can have anything he wants and not die a virgin.  He totally completes his goals, rich and sleeps with lots of women.  Madison is looking for Mr. Right she decides to go looking for her half-brother and ends up being rescued by Knox.  This is a fast paced read with characters that both know what they want from life or at least they think so.  I enjoyed the story as well as the characters."
LOVE THESE LITTLE STORIES. I READ TO MY GRAND BABIES AS THEY LOVE BOOKS.  MY OLDER GRAND BABY READS TO US ALSO. CUTE AND VERY AGE APPROPRIATE.
"I really enjoyed this story. I like when the H/H of a story are of different classes as it adds an interesting twist as the story unfolds.  Henry and Matilda were both fighting the attraction they felt for the other, but since they knew that it wouldn't be proper for anything to happen, the tension just kept building. When William needed help, it was just what they needed to give into their desires.

This is a BDSM story, so it might not appeal to everyone.

Thanks go out to LLD Press via NetGalley for a copy of the book in exchange of an honest review."
"This series is becoming one of my favorites! You can never lose with Eliza Gayle. She is one of the best! Malcolm was erotic, suspenseful, and intriguing. The chemistry between the two main characters was amazing, it definitely kept me on my toes and I couldn't put it down."
"I thoroughly enjoyed this book although there were a couple of things that bugged me and I wish I'd picked them up in the reviews so I could've been prepared. I'll include them in the spoilers so that you'll know if you want. This story is about the h, who owns her own struggling vintage fashion store and has inherited her grandmother's house. She loves the house and is slowly repairing it. Her shop is going through a difficult patch and her house is in chaos with builders taking time to fix things. She broke up with her long time boyfriend a year previously and took a long time to get over him. Out of the blue he reappears and wants to get back together. There is a sexy lodger that she takes in to help things along and there is a side story about getting her shop into the black again.

+++Spoilers+++
I didn't like that this book mostly focussed on the love life with the old boyfriend. We are introduced to the new H but that takes until the end to get going. There is a sequel to come to next year. It isn't a cliff hanger but I was a bit bummed to keep reading about the h having sex with the old boyfriend.

I would definitely buy the next book when it comes out though."
FUn read.
"Style has penned a great story. I couldn't out it down. Wonderful, flawed characters who have to fight  for what they want. Characters who have to learn to forgive themselves and each other. This was the 3rd in the series, all are good reading."
"Pretty good for a short story. It has a beginning, middle, and end. Character development. If you are looking for literature you may be disappointed. Overall, the was an enjoyable and interesting read- not something you can usually say about the kindle freebies you find."
"This is the story of Anna. She begins to dream about a Columbine type disaster at her High School. Before too long she realizes that others in her school are having the same dream. She also realizes she can influence the dreams. If she can influence the dreams can she stop the disaster from happening?

This is billed as a YA story but I enjoyed it despite the fact that I am far older than that! I loved the idea of lucid dreaming and the paranormal spin on the whole thing. Anna was a strong heroine, suddenly finding herself having to deal with far more than the usual teenage angst. It can't be easy having the fate of so many people on your shoulders! Her supporting cast were believable and real. The story had a good pace to it, never flagging. The twist at the end blew me away. It wasd a clever way to end the story and I certainly never saw it coming!

A great paranormal thriller for young adults and upwards. I urge you to give it a try.

I received a complimentary of this book in order to review."
"Adam and Aurora are smoking hot together.

Adam and Aurora were separated by a tragic event a few years prior, but events from the past don't stand a chance against what these two have.  As hot as they were together, their relationship was also sweet and I loved that. Bear His Mark was a great story and a great introduction to the Wylde Den Series!"
I thought it started out slow. Then all of a sudden I was drawn into this book. The spark and dilemma between them?!? Omg !! I can't wait to read the next book.
"Great hot sex scenes for menage.  I also enjoyed how well the author developed the relationships.  The storyline did not really interest me that much.  Therefore one less star.  Also, five stars for me is if I am rushing out to purchase other titles by the author.  While I would recommend this book and may purchase others by this author later, I'm in no rush."
"This book - and several others about dieting - low carb, vegan, the life diet, etc. -  all seem to be written by the same 'team' of people using different names. I skimmed through quite a few (free with kindle prime) and the endings are all the same, telling you to check out some guy's ab book and website.  (Not paying that much!)
Gave this book three stars because it is amusing and may be helpful to someone whether it's 'true' or not."
Loved reading the series of Novellas! Loved the stories and characters! If you like historical Highland romance this is a very good series
I read this straight through.  Now can't wait to get into book 2.  Nerdy beautiful girl meets Rick star. Says no but Rick star pursues her and she falls in love. He has to go on tour and the distance is hard for them.  Cliffhanger
"Wow wow wow! I just finished Roy's story and it is everything I hoped for and more. The first books really didn't go into him very much. He was always the quiet one brooding alone in the corner. Never really talking much except for the occasional one word. You knew he cared about his band brothers and you just felt that something had broken him inside but in this book you find out all that truly happened to make him the way he is.

I personally love Roy. Montana will always be my favorite but there was just something about Roy that made me fall in love with him. I think it's the fixer in me. I would of loved to know him and just hug him. Listen to his story and be there for him. That's why I loved Kelsey. She did just that. She understood Roy because she had been through the same crushing heartbreak as him. She knew what it was like to be in love and have that person shatter you in a million pieces. It's a life changer but with Roy it was different. They found solace in each other. Each giving as much as the other.

This is truly my favorite of this series so far. Shanora told Roy's story so well. He is a lover and a fighter and he proved it over again. Yeah he screwed up but who doesn't. I'm totally satisfied with this story. No questions left unanswered no regret.. This is truly one to read if you love the FireNine boys.. I can't wait for they next.."
This is an easy read I thought the writing was good and  the story cute.would read other books by this author.
"I actually clicked on this book on Net Galley by accident so I was dragging my feet about reading it. I had several preconceived notions about the book and I figured the plot would follow the standard sports romance troupe where the quarterback is some hot shot with an ego the size of Texas and a notorious womanizer. What I encountered was quite the contrary.

I was immediately drawn into the story and stayed up well into the early morning hours to finish the book. The primary and secondary characters totally anchored me to the story.  I loved Cassie. She is a total tech nerd with a smart mouth and witty commentary. The characters were easily relatable and thoroughly enjoyable.

I really appreciated the direction the author went with Treys character. He did not want to be in the spotlight and preferred anonymity. Trey was also a genuinely nice guy. I loved how he cared for a troubled teammate on several occasions in the book. I also loved how much he cared for Cassie and wanted to build on the feelings that were developing between the two instead of pushing her away. Their romance was beautifully written and developed naturally.

This is my first read from Jeanette Murray and I am so glad I took a chance on it. I loved every aspect of the story and the only unpleasant thing I can mention is that we have to wait until October 2014 for the next book in the series.

I was gifted an eBook copy from the publisher via Net Galley in exchange for an honest review. All conclusions reached are my own."
"***Recieved a copy of this book from the author for a honest review * *

  Reviewer for Book Fancy Blog  

For a debut novel Desiree hit it out of the park.  It gives you all the emotional up and downs and I loved it. I was so caught up I didn't even realized I was at the end until I read The End.

Both men are Hot, smart, and sexy as sin. I felt for Nikki because she truly wanted Sky to get his act together but fell in love with Jack.  I don't want to spoil anything but this book ends with a cliffhanger.

I'm so looking forward to seeing who Nikki chooses in this love triangle."
"I loved this book because it helps when you look for signs in relationships. Give someone a chance and don't jump to conclusions, but also watch what triggers another's emotions."
