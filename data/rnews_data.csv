"Because the modern battlefield uses the benefits of vehicles and firearms. The majority of positions for general soldiers don't need the Hollywood idea of what a soldier is.

"I think that over the last 10 years or so, people report things more than they used to.  Part of that is because everyone has a smartphone with a camera, so it's easier to document and prove some crimes and bad behaviors in general... Also MeToo has encouraged people.

But in just this last year of the pandemic, I bet you're right, and some 'flasher' types and other predators have been more frustrated and are more eager to get their hands on victims...  

The ones who have their victims at home (the domestic abusers) have probably been the opposite of frustrated - since they can abuse away without the normal risks of getting caught (like a teacher seeing bruises)..

It's tempting to think that the declines are permanent, but there are still millions of live cases circulating in the population, and the possibility of more virulent strains emerging.

Weirdly the message doesn't get through to some segments of the population.  If they don't feel personally threatened by COVID-19, they may write it off as a thing that happens to people they don't know so who cares?  It's just another cold at worst.

The spring breakers who are oblivious to the pandemic around them are being led by a primal instinct that overrules any rational thought.  If you're over 30 and still acting like this it's a lot more pathetic."

"Here’s how you’re wrong.

You’re making a strawman argument firstly. This case has nothing to do with systemic racism in the police, or even the facts of the case—facts that weren’t derived from bodycam footage, or even an internal investigation, but from security cam footage from the store, and likely an eyewitness account from a scared af manager who wasn’t even supposed to be there that day. This previously convicted violent felon resisted arrest and got tased. Failing that, decided he should fight with the officer and shoot him dead over—and I cannot stress this enough—*a pack of t-shirts.* Mind you, these shots could have easily penetrated a wall and killed an innocent person. He then escapes at speeds of up to 140 mph, endangering god knows how many others, and is apprehended *alive* by a bunch of cops had every reason to believe he was a deadly threat.

Do not let anger and an admittedly justifiable history of police fuckery blind you to the objective facts. Always question your biases"

Canada also was one of the main nations hosting the British Commonwealth Air Training Program during WWII.  Some of them have been heavily used by NATO during the past years yet are no longer used.

Quite a bit of old stuff that's less frequently used hasn't really been updated since WWII but they managed to make do in my experience."

It’s too bad we don’t react to police getting shot in the face with the same ferocity as suspects and criminals getting shot. Hope the guy behind this gets the death penalty, he deserves it."

&amp;#x200B;

A company borrows $100 **of stock** from a broker who's holding, with a promise to give it back with $2 interest in one month.

You sell the stock and tell everybody it's going down further. If it goes down you buy it back for say $95, pocket $5 net, return the ~~$100~~ $95 stock plus $2 to the broker, profit $3."
"Sure, absolutely. He already is: by enforcing more COVID safety guidelines, setting a personal example, putting in place a nationally organized system for vaccine distribution and data sharing, and unmuzzling public health officials, Biden has undoubtedly improved the trajectory of the pandemic.

&gt;For most of us regulars here the writing is on the wall just as it was for Satoshi back in 2008. This GME fiasco is yet another prime example of the corporate elite, banksters, government leaders, and billionaires and the rigged game they play. That's what birthed bitcoin, and this round 2 is going to cement it.

&gt;The GME stuff hasn't ended yet and nobody knows exactly how it will all play out, but there is one thing that is certain. Some regular joe's will lose their shirts, regulations will change against us peasants, the banksters and hedges will lick their wounds and you guessed it... still be billionaires.

&gt;The game is rigged, we found a flaw, we exploited it fair and square, it will be fixed and the game restarted with even worse odd for us.

&gt;This is going to cement Bitcoin with 1000 foot deep pilings. The people who are trying to change the rules on wallstreet midgame are the same that say ""bitcoin is too speculative and manipulative"". NAhhhhhh that's bullshit. What they mean is they can't be the ones who control it in any real capacity. That's why they don't want it. GME made that ever more evident.

&gt;Buckle up ladies and gents. Bitcoin and crypto are here to fucking stay and the fallout from GME is going to send this shit higher and higher. There's no denying the need for crypto and blockchain now. Not a single fucking thing negative can be said that isn't laden with hypocrisy and contradiction, not when you got billionaires crying foul about losing their own game. There's outrage and the hammer is gonna come down over a publicly traded company being publicly traded by the public in public for all to see. How dare citizens do that!(sarcasm)

"Hedge funds accustomed to poring through arcane corners of earnings reports in search of companies to bet against are turning their sights on foul-mouthed online message boards in an effort to stay ahead of day traders who have started beating them at their own game.

Since early 2020, alternative data provider Quiver Quantitative has been scraping data off the now 4.5m-strong Reddit message board r/WallStreetBets, identifying the most talked-about companies, and using language processing to determine whether sentiment is positive or negative.

In the past few days numerous institutions and large hedge funds have been in touch asking for additional real-time data about discussions happening on Reddit forums, said James Kardatzke, Quiver chief executive and co-founder

“Everyone is looking at Melvin and these other hedge funds that went short as a cautionary tale,” he said. “You need to be aware of where retail might be able to blow up a position, or where there might be a real surge on retail interest,” he said.

The surge in interest comes after hedge fund Melvin Capital was this week forced into a rescue package from other investors after an unprecedented assault by individual traders crushed its bet against console retailer GameStop. Others do not want to fall into the same trap.

The head of one of the world’s biggest hedge fund firms told the Financial Times it was planning to start using natural language processing to scour forums such as Reddit to avoid being caught in pile-ons against negative bets. “Reddit is definitely a risk management issue. It’s at the top of our agenda,” the person said.

Reddit and other social media platforms are now playing a more central role in financial markets, said David Lebovitz, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “Now you will be able to tap into less traditional sources of information to figure out how retail is positioned. This is a segment of the market that has been historically opaque, and now we’re beginning to flash a light around.”"

As for 401ks, I believe a little over one third of all working Americans have one, which is a rather substantial amount.  Where are you hearing about this reclassification as contractors thing though?  This is the first I have ever seen that.  Furthermore, Biden has regularly said his goal is to actually **get rid of 401ks** in their current form, and instead offer something like a **static 26%** tax credit for retirement investing.  This would be a huge retirement boon for the overwhelming majority of Americans, as the overwhelming majority of Americans are simply not in this effective tax bracket.  Keep in mind that you progress through bracket, so 26% is actually a very high bracket."

"Being more upfront about the motivations could help forsure.  Although I think most people dont read that much into scientific papers, they'll basically look at the abstract and determine if they think the research is biased in its motivation and either accept or disregard the findings based on that.  To an extent I think thats just naturally how people are going to behave and I'm not sure what can really be done about it.

Personally I think its more of a media problem than a scientific community problem.  Theres plenty of, quite frankly, manipulative data circulated about any topic but the media sort of cherry picks when they want to ""debunk"" or malign something which makes it look like the scientific community has an agenda when its really just the media's agenda if that makes sense.  At least that's my opinion anyway."

"Yeah there are shared-use trails in a lot of parks, but for the sake of preventing erosion to trails and protecting habitats and wildlife from disruption, horses are not permitted on many trails even within parks that have shared-use trails. Horses are very destructive to the ground (much worse than mountain bikes, comparable to ATVs), and of course being large, frequently-defecating, and sometimes loud animals they also can create a fair bit of a disturbance.

Horses are also very expensive though and often a signature luxury for the rural rich, and many people don't give half a shit about protecting anything beyond their own nose. Consequently, many horse riders see the occasional fine (typically $75-300 depending largely on the park, which is of course pocket change to someone making six or seven digits a year) as nothing more than the cost of doing whatever they want."

"The DEA can force a surrender to your point if there is action taken on the professional license. It certainly [happens](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/actions/2020/index.html)

If you read through some of the cases the decisions on registration surrendering can comes years after action the professional license. Why is there such a delay? The DEA’s expectations for action by the pharmacies/pharmacists are much higher that the standard they demonstrate.

Further why isn’t the DEA more vocal in seeking slight updates to the CSA to get permission to cancel DEA numbers absent the professional license requirements? I can’t see a logical arguement that any politician might have in giving the DEA more authority in clamping down on pill mills. If I’m wrong however and this is unconstitutional or not something the government (and people) believe is appropriate, I find it hard to understand how the DEA has any justified arguement in essentially imposing these same responsibilities on pharmacies and pharmacists.  Why isn’t the DEA suing state medical licensing boards that are not taking action against pill mills? Why isn’t the DEA suing medicaid or Medicare for continuing to enable fraud by high volume prescribers? For decades the DEA has received copies of all narcotic order forms placed  by pharmacies. Why sit on the order records for years and seek action years after the fact for extreme dispensing and not notify the pharmacies they might be being targeted by drug seekers based on some recent unusual activity? How is any given pharmacy supposed to know that they are ordering an unusual amount compared to others when they don’t know how much others are ordering? How is Walmart suppposed to know how much Walgreens or cvs is ordering for them to recognize it’s unusual.

If a pharmacist misses a red flag and let’s an inappropriate prescription go out, it’s their fault and face potential repercussions. If a pharmacist is over-vigilant and just feels a prescription is shady and turns it away, they are now a barrier to care and may face repercussions on any implications of a delay in therapy. Like all humans pharmacists make mistakes and miss things. It’s unfortunate but happens. If you’re too careful or not enough careful in this regard you can face repercussions. If we want pharmacists to play a logical role here (which they can) let’s pick just one side where they can face punishment if they miss."

"They pay the teachers so little it's not that much of an adjustment financially to take a stand, assuming they're not barely scraping by to begin with.

Paying a teacher too little is like paying your babysitter too little. It pushes away qualified people into different roles and leaves children open to those who aren't really there for the compensation to begin with."

"As an she care worker in QLD Australia, the flu shot became mandatory last year. I had mine for the first time. I had been on the fence, never having had the flu in my life but resigned myself, for the greater good. Ironically, with covid and lockdown or flu rate in Australia was nowhere near what it normally is... All of us here accept that Covid vaccination will be mandatory too. 

Putting the onus on the care worker without a well run Govt system and education campaign isn't great though. Quite a few are older, poorly trained and educated and there can be language and cultural barriers as well. 

Personally I think there's a responsibility of govt to make these things mandatory. I think it's glaringly obvious that you can't just leave things to people to do the right thing anymore. With all the ongoing manipulation of information, people don't know what's right anymore...

You need to incentivise. Either a carrot(higher rates of pay for vaccinated staff/extra week vacation/bonus payments), or a staff. - no Jab/no work.

"&gt; What I'm hearing isn't about the compensation, but exactly as I stated, the myriad of problems with the education system.

Listen, clearly they aren't going to hire a nurse or a social worker or a psychologist. We all know that.

So instead I just want to be paid for the jobs I am doing.

&gt;If you were paid exactly what you are paid now, but had the resources and ability to teach how you wanted, along with proper support staff at the school doing their jobs, would you be alright with that? If 'yes', then I'd argue your teacher compensation isn't the problem, but the education system and other systemic problems.

""If you were asked to do 1/3 of the work for the same pay and that made you happier, compensation isn't the problem.""

Did I paraphrase that correctly? If so, I think you can see how ridiculous it is.

I am not suggesting I want a million dollar salary for the record. I want to be paid fairly for the job I do. That means more money, or less work. So yes, it is about compensation. :)"
The fact that it has a perfect curved edge and pointed tip
"There's a lot of blue collar jobs don't prioritize safety. Manufacturing, trucking, construction, and warehousing are fields that I've personally worked in, and good companies exist in all of those, but there also always was and always will be plenty of fly-by-night companies (including larger ones) that don't give a shit about worker health and safety, and spend more effort dodging regulations. Most people end up in those places because they need a job _now_, and stay there because they can't afford to quit/get fired, and their only recourse is to report them, maybe get the company a small fine, and be back to being unemployed."
"That's because everybody in Texas knows the score -- that any real union activities would result in mass firings because school districts in Texas just don't care whether they have qualified teachers in their classrooms, they'd replace them all with unqualified (but cheap) long term subs if the state would let them."

&gt;There was an active felony warrant for his arrest at the time.

&gt;Blake had been charged a month earlier with third-degree sexual assault, a felony, and two misdemeanors, trespassing and disorderly conduct, in connection with an altercation at his girlfriend's home several weeks earlier. Under his deal with prosecutors, Blake pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of disorderly conduct involving domestic abuse.

&gt;A dispatcher told officers that a woman called for police and said that ""Jacob Blake isn’t supposed to be there and he took the complainant's keys and is refusing to give them back.”  

&gt;According to Matthews, ""Sheskey watched Blake put one child in the car as he arrived but was unaware that two more children were already in the vehicle,"" CNN reports. ""Another officer heard a woman yelling that Blake had her children, he said, but did not see the kids in the car.""

&gt;As Sheskey and two other officers tried to arrest Blake, they fired a Taser at him twice but it did not stop him, according to the DOJ.

&gt;Matthews in his CNN interview said between the two uses of the Taser, Blake briefly placed Sheskey in a headlock.

&gt;Matthews said after the second Taser did not stop Blake, the officers noticed he was holding a knife and demanded he drop it.

&gt;According to video of the encounter, Blake walked around the front of the  car to the driver's side door with the object in his hand. The officers followed him with their guns drawn, then Blake opened the car door and began to go inside.

Blake was known to the police as a domestic abuser, had a restraining order, violated said restraining order, threatened his (former) girlfriend and her kids, took her keys and put the children in the car, resisted arrest - even after two tasers were shot at him, pulled a knife on the officers and then tried to get into the driver seat of a car with three children in the back.

Is police supposed to stand by, while someone, who's clearly out of control and armed with a knife, kidnaps three children? Why are we defending this guy, acting like he did nothing wrong?"
Its almost like charges are filed and convictions are obtained when something wrong actually occurs. I'll take a 98.9 percent success rate on cops handling difficult situations. Nice

Kids are being hospitalized at high rates now. (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.beaconjournal.com/amp/6505807002) They're at risk too. Online schooling works and is easier than ever. You can't just quarantine all at-risk people but let kids go to school because many of them have immunocompromised parents, live with grandparents, etc.

But yeah, obviously wanting to safely see her daughter before she possibly dies of cancer makes her a ""selfish cunt."" Classy."
"Yeah but in the video, there are I believe 4 cops just pointing guns? I’m saying why wouldn’t they not group together to tackle him and pin him?

Having a knife in your car isn't intent."
He stated to the police that he had a weapon and he was going to go get it from his car and use it at which point they try to deploy tasers on him which were uneffective.
It's amazing how you got almost all the most crucial aspects of this particular case wrong. 5th degree criminal sexual misconduct in Minnesota is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year in prison and the guy does NOT have to register as a sex offender. Does this sound like an appropriate penalty for raping someone?

"China didn't allow the WHO to inspect the labs for months after the outbreak. Plenty of time to scrub evidence.

"Huh? Now I don't know what you mean by ""exponentially"".

There's a specific technical meaning for ""exponentially"" when you are talking about an ongoing process that is changing things.

For the community, the number of vaccines going out isn't increasing exponentially, but just linearly (or maybe quadratically, since it is accelerating slightly).

But at this point, this is just me peeving about someone taking a word with a precise meaning, and changing the meaning to just ""a lot"". Not much more to be gained by resisting this than by resisting the change of ""literally""."

Take 9/11 (Twin towers incident) for example, what did you see for around 2 years straight on the media? Terrorist attacks, bombings, Muslims being extremists and yelling things to the camera, etc. right? That was what was portrayed. *What was actually happening in their countries?* Daily regular citizen activity. Countless Arabic people I knew in my city (Montreal, QC) has families back there and tell me their lives were nothing like what was portrayed on TV and were living regular peaceful lives. Only a small small small percentage are erratic and willing to do unnecessary things to the US. But what was on TV? Muslims = bad. Why? Because the US had their ""motives"" (Oil, politics, etc.)

Right now, China is destroying and has been destroying US's economy for years. So do we need to state the ""motive"" here?

And now, this Chinese Tennis player, was she found? Yes. Is he alive? Yes.

"Using [Wisconsin self defense statutes](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/939/iii/48) as the example: 

&gt;	939.48  Self-defense and defense of others.
(1)  A person is privileged to threaten or intentionally use force against another for the purpose of preventing or terminating what the person reasonably believes to be an unlawful interference with his or her person by such other person. The actor may intentionally use only such force or threat thereof as the actor reasonably believes is necessary to prevent or terminate the interference. **The actor may not intentionally use force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm unless the actor reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself.**

So basically, the force must be proportional to the threat.  Lethal force is permitted only to prevent death or great bodily harm.  

Showing up to a protest (on either side) would not meet that definition."

"Of course threatening to commit a capital crime can be ethical. For instance, if I'm embarrassed and say, ""kill me now,"" my use of an aphorism wouldn't be unethical. The courts have correctly identified that hyperbolic threats are protected speech, whether it's a comedy sketch by a conservative congressman on Twitter that casts different congressmen in the roles of different animae characters or it's some frustrated liberal saying that, ""former President Trump should be hung for treason,"" or frustrated conservatives at a protest chanting, ""hang Mike Pence.""

It only crosses a line both when we directly threaten someone in some way where they would reasonably believe that there is a real possibility of the threat being carried out and our intention is to make them apprehend a credible threat. That's also the line drawn by the Supreme Court. Hyperbolic or rhetorical   threats are protected speech."
“Terrorist far left” LMFAOOOOO
"No, I didn’t. Quit putting words in my mouth. I said as many as it takes to stop the threat. They found the threshold and guess what, he’s alive. The prosecution office said it was a justified shooting and they pressed no charges. And you can’t say the prosecution is biased or racist, or whatever term you want to use because they dragged Kyle through the mud despite having clear evidence it was self defense.

The human body is incredibly malleable when it comes to taking bullets. This is from The Sydney Morning Herald “Mr Alvarez survived a record… ‘more than 20 gunshot wounds’”. 20, during a gunfight with police after he had killed another individual following an argument. 

In Toronto, Jamal “The Miracle Man” was a victim of attempted robbery. The three men robbing him shot him over 30 times. 

It has nothing to do with his race, so take the race goggles off and just look at him as a man who had sexually assaulted someone and then grabbed a knife threatening the cops. 

If there is an instance where there is actual proof that someone with racist intentions did something atrocious, like Dylan Roof, then alright, we are on the same page. Roof should get the chair and forget the sponge. But you need evidence, and right now, you got none for either of which you are arguing for. And if you can’t even agree to that, then you are unreasonable person living in a world that deals in reason."

The threat of a punch was not what made this a life or death scenario. The presence of the gun and the possibility that rosenbaum might somehow rip it off kyles chest and use it against him is what made it life or death. I hope that you can see that."

"I think…that’s probably a deadly way to view the world. Not everything is a kill or be killed situation. If someone was pointing a gun at me, I would want to have that gun; not to kill them, but to not have a gun pointed at me. If that other person assumed I wanted to kill them with their own gun, I would be dead. They have no idea what my intent is, because they just assume everything is a kill or be killed situation."
Nothing short of a live interview outside of China will even come close to what's necessary.
"&gt; I bet the definition of provoke is difficult to pin down

Not really no.   

-Attack someone physically    
-Threaten physical harm then engage in behaviour that demonstrates intent to follow through (like chasing someone trying to run away).   
-Brandishing a weapon (keep in mind that you are not brandishing a weapon simply by carrying it, for example if you are carrying an AR brandishing would require some sort of explicitly threatening move, like pointing the weapon at you).

That's pretty much it.

&gt; If I call you a horrible name and give you my address, is that provoking?

No.    
Technically the first part *could* fall under the ""fighting words"" doctrine if sufficiently atrocious and not public speech, but in the scenario you describe it wouldn't simply for the fact that we are in immediate proximity (face to face) so I wouldn't be able to argue that I found whatever you said so offensive that I reacted instinctively.   
Plus you'd have to get fairly inventive with it, being offensive is not by itself sufficient and considering what they've already ruled as *not* being fighting words I'm not quite sure how you'd even be sufficiently insulting to qualify at this point.

Might be a case of mutual combat though if I should show up (I would not, fighting without having to is not a smart thing to do)."

"&gt;Had he not been armed, he'd 100% be ok with that, somehow I think you're fine with that.....

I assume you mean he'd be dead?  If so, how, who would have killed him?  The pedophile was unarmed and was a little midget, what was he going to beat Rittenhouse to death?  Very unlikely.  None of those other guys would have had cause to attack Rittenhouse if Rittenhouse didn't shoot Rosenbaum in the first place.

What about running up on someone with your gun drawn and pointed at them?
"No. A police officer has the legal right to chase and shoot a dangerous fleeing suspect in limited circumstances. A non-police person does not have the right to chase and shoot a fleeing person.

Both of my in-laws are crazy deep into it. They are cordial to us and still invite us to holidays, but she was the last one to even be told about all of her siblings' engagements and pregnancies. Which is another sore spot for her, because we were the ones to plan out everything 2 years in advance and wait for her to finish school and everything, but two of her sisters started dating, got engaged and even married within a span of weeks just before our wedding. We suspect they subconsciously decided they weren't going to let an apostate show she had her life together more than her family's."

I wonder how long we'll be needing to repeat boosters. We're still only in the early stages.

I also wish pfizer had a vax without PEG that I could take. That seemed to be the only thing I reacted to from what I could tell. I'm scared of the blood clot issues in a couple of the others, and I need to get some kind of clearance from my docs what might be safe for me."

"&gt; The reason slavery ended was because we changed the law. 

I’m not asking about why it was changed, I’m asking do you legitimately believe that while it was legal it was the right thing? Do you believe people like John Brown and Harriet Tubman who broke the law to intimidate slave owners and push for emancipation were wrong to break the law, and should have been punished?


&gt; stopping holocaust and overthrowing Hitler was perfectly legal under US law because we were are war. Morality had nothing to do with it.

It was legal under US law, but not under German law. Why do you consider US law supreme in this instance? Do you think that while the Holocaust was happening and the US wasn’t at war with Germany it was good because it was legal?

&gt; Someone else could legitimately have the opposite view that the US is an imperialist power that has invaded and killed women and children all over the world, where as China has not invaded any country in decades. Therefore, overthrowing the US government is moral, while overthrowing Chinese government isn't.

&gt; Of course you can hold two positions. You can believe the US is an imperialist nation and China is an oppressive regime. In both instances here - China and The US the authoritarian ones are in the wrong. You can believe China has no authority to exert itself on the people of Hong Kong, and Donald Trumps attempt to overturn a democratic election are wrong. Donald Trumps insurrection was wrong and should have been stopped, and Chinas oppression of the people of Hong Kong is wrong and should be opposed. What are you struggling with?"

"They knowingly and completely rely on desperate job-seekers who just need a job, any job, or young people who don't have enough experience in the workforce to know that their company's poor management and training is not the norm. Many companies aren't blind to this tactic, this IS their tactic and they know it. I have worked at one and can name a few where this is their employee model and extreme churn and turnover is already accounted for.  You can see this in bad software/tech companies that sell crap products; they churn through salespeople and customer support and bleed workers in every department. Places where there's a sea of entry/junior levels and barely a senior level in sight except for a lone manager somewhere, stretched thin across too many direct reports to properly train and guide.

These two groups of people are willing to work for crap pay (sometimes just $1 or $2 above min wage) to get their foot in the door and get that 1 year of experience in that specific job. Once the worker gets the skills for their resume and that 1 year of employment so they won't look *too* flighty for the next company's HR, they immediately jump ship for greener grass. And so the cycle continues."

Personally, I’d be fine coming in 2x a week. It would be a nice balance between saving gas and commuter time, and not feeling like a shut-in. Our office food is really good, and the campus is nice enough that I missed it in quarantine, so that factors heavily. If it was some office park cube, I’d come in as little as possible."

and  trying to force it on people, listen to your bias speaking and the double standard

&gt; You not getting the vaccine isn't just a personal choice, you are actively raising the risk that other people around you can be infected by the virus potentially living in you

&gt; It's morally and ethically bankrupt to avoid this vaccine if you have no valid medical reason not to get it

people think it will harm them, so theres the valid reason for a a big portion of the population

i dont agree with you're definition of moral and ethical, I take all recommend   safety guidance (i know i cant speak for all other vaccines refusing people) that to me is moral and ethical. 

why arent you pushing getting healthy vitamin D levels and exercise? people who lack these things suffer more seriously from the virus (look it up), no, the only thing being pushed by you and the govt and media is the vaccine, not any of the other things that will save you from the harm of the virus.  why? thats why makes me question is getting people healthy the end goal, or is pushing the vaccine the main goal? if not suspicious,  its not right how things are getting done"

"I used to also work in kitchens as a cook, and if you even dared to ask what time you might be getting off work they would threaten to fire you. Same with Old Navy when I worked there, but to a different extent because they were ran by a corporation. If you refused to stay past your shift anytime they asked you they would start cutting hours off your schedule."
"&gt; The government does not push the flu vaccine or any other vaccine as hard as the CoVid-19 vac.

Gee, if only there was a perfectly simple and rational explanation for that like, oh, I dunno, COVID-19 being the most dangerous virus currently at loose in the community and that needs to be controlled to save thousands of lives."
I hope you muzzle it too.
"It's been 2 years and I've been fully vaccinated so I doubt it will say anything useful. 6 months was definitely the worst of it, I smoked way back when heavily so that's probably dragging it out too, glad to hear it goes away eventually.

"Quite alright, it's understandable. He's quite well aware of the usual sentiments and jokes concerning lawyers and their actions, even tells quite a few of those himself.

And like anyone else, lawyers are a varied people. This family member in particular doesn't really stand on ceremony, quite frequently as an arbitrator he sets the expected decorum as ""Casual"" (no need for suits and such). Meanwhile, now and then he comes across an opposing lawyer that's an insufferable ass, doing stuff like INSISTING everyone refer to them as ""Doctor Whatever"" due to their Doctorate. Apparently in such situations, the family member will insist that the person in question must refer to THEM as Doctor, but allows everyone else to get away with first name only.

Lawyers are a bit like IT people. Most of the world only interacts with them when things are going VERY badly."

"Frito-Lay is owned by PepsiCo.

PepsiCo just reported their second quarter earnings this morning, coincidentally. Do you know how much *profit* they made in the past three months? $3,100,000,000. Three *billion* dollars, in 90 days.

Yes, you shut the line down and you pay your people the rest of their shift. A coworker, and maybe a friend, just died in front of your team.

You do this because you value people, or, more cynically, you do this because it earns you loyalty and keeps you out of the papers. You do this because the cost of wages/product lost is less than the cost they're going to pay now in PR and lost productivity from the strike.

They're not under fire, they're not saving lives, and they're not launching rockets - they're *making snacks*. This isn't a matter of life and death.

Or, at least, it shouldn't be.

"Big companies with facilities like this operate on the basis that why will always have high turnover. They keep a pool of not-yet-new hires to be able to quickly fill vacancies. 

The third-party agencies are responsible for finding the bodies and keeping the pool filled. If they are unable to, their contracts with the corporation they are hiring for is cut or canceled altogether. This causes the hired contractors to have to deal with whatever the new agency can offer them as far as pay and insurance goes. It also affects those who are employed by the corporation working along side the contractors because the agencies will often cut corners while looking for new hires when they have trouble keeping that pool filled. This means folks who maybe shouldn’t be operating machinery are now being hired and pushed through which directly impacts quality (which usually reflects on bonuses) and safety. Everyone is hurt when corporate doesn’t want to hire their own and pay everyone what they deserve. Everyone except those in the corporate office, that is."

"I used to work for a former Frito exec who’s now a bp at a large organic cpg.  He’s a certifiable sociopath - and I quit as a result of behavior so bad that I involved the police.  And I’m a senior level professional with 3 decades of experience.  In my experience - and I’ve had great and terrible - people behave largely how they’re incented to.  And at that level - the incentives (bonuses) are HUGE.  Massive.  To the point where execs - if they do not have a moral compass (or if their org does not have a cultural moral compass) - are wont to do whatever they possibly can to get their bonus - because of they do so successfully 1x or 2x - it frankly doesn’t matter what happens next.  Fire them?  Fine - they’ve got millions to rest on.  

THIS is what’s going to collapse capitalism."
"they know it is easier to get elected on dumbed down policies that get people hot under the collar, rather than complicated nuanced policy that address real issues.   in that respect, conservative politics has a huge advantage.. it's a buttload easier to get people onside who have little knowledge of actual issues. see brexit"
"There are heroin maintenance programs in some European countries, for a long time now. They work very well. Compared to no treatment or substitution (methadone etc), they're more effective at allowing users to maintain stable housing and employment, and substantially reduce other crimes (since there's no need to interact with criminals and raise large amounts of money to pay for it). 

Most issues with housing are financial, and most issues with jobs involve missing work because you're sick or trying to score, or because you're inadvertently too high.

Then because there's known dosages usually under supervision, ODs are basically eliminated.

Since prohibition doesn't actually work, and compelled abstinence based treatment fails like 99% of the time, *this* is how you minimize the harm drugs cause when faced with an inability to eliminate them."

"There’s negatives to unions of course (the positives far outweigh them) but honestly, being in one, I feel like a big part of it is because most members don’t participate in the governing as much as they should, myself included. So shitty people can work their way up the chain of influence or decisions like donating to a particular candidate may not represent the whole body.

As far as the dues go, the raises I’ve gotten because of the collective bargaining far outpace any union dues. Compared to other places in the industry in my city that aren’t unionized, the difference in pay and benefits is palpable."

Also, as the riot started, there's reports of trump being excited and pleased, which explains the very slow response of calling in the national guard for extra support."
"What about the ones that owned slaves, or the one that caused the Civil War, or the one that destroyed Reconstruction Era, or the one that interned Japanese Americans in camps, or the one that dropped a nuke, or the one that refused to pull out of Vietnam, or the one that killed a million civilians in the Middle East?

Sure but she can’t outwardly denounce her sister/ Republican Party without ruffling a few feathers. Best to keep her mouth shut until Dick passes away and she gets her good girl nut. Then she can blast away.
"On the one hand, yes you are correct. On the other, it’s their job to represent their constituents. It’s a little hypocritical for us to rail at trump for attacking democratic institutions and then get all pissy because congressional representatives represent their districts (gerrymandered as they are)."
"No beer, but I have a bit weed and hash here. I also only have half a bag chips and a bag of walnuts when it comes to snacks. I have baguettes, salad, tomatoes, gherkins, sausages and 4 different types of cheese, so I definitely could make sandwiches. I just had one of those though."

"It may be later than that, McConnell defied tradition by refusing to have hearings for any of Biden’s nominees so if they start the trial on the 19th it’ll seriously delay those confirmations. Biden wants them to wait a few months, because it makes no difference when they do it once Trump is out of office."
"Exactly, so if the political precedent is that you can get away with this shit with just a slap on the wrist (or that impeachment in general has lost its teeth altogether), then we need to either make impeachment count again by following it up with a conviction, or just acknowledge that it doesn't mean anything and there are no consequences. 

Only one of these scenarios seems likely right now, and I don't like which one it is."
I thought the purpose of a government was to prevent one person from having too much power or calling all the shots?
Just like you first pay income tax and then sales tax/toll etc. What a lovely world!

"It's a relic of how old the traditions are and how reluctant they are to change them.  The frequent breaks dates back to when they decided to build the nation's capitol in a southern swamp 150 years before air-conditioning was invented.  The legislature only met for like half the year, and spent the other half at home tending their plantations, campaigning, polling their electorate, ""polling their electorate"", etc.  The President was the only official expected to always be in the capitol.

The 1900's demanded they meet somewhat more frequently, as they couldn't really go the whole summer anymore without the country starting to go haywire.  Still, AC remained a few decades off, so they made sure to take off the entire month of August.  They still take off the entire month of August, and frequent week-long recesses, because they have no vested interest in changing those rules, regardless of the existence of AC removing the need for them."

"&gt; A special prosecutor said in September that the shooting was “possibly avoidable” but **ruled it was justified** because it **could not be said that Schutte's belief he was in danger was unreasonable**.

"I know everyone likes to gravitate toward the extreme to prove their point, but incarceration is the punishment. Not freezing to death. Also, the first inmate in the article is locked up for drug charges and is not a violent felon."
"What about people convicted for something like embezzling, hacking, or selling or smoking weed. Do they deserve to nearly freeze to death for their crimes?

Even if you believe that rapists and murderers should be punished so severely (remember the us constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishments) surely that doesn't apply to everyone in prison, or jails.

Also. Big difference between comfortable and not being able to feel your own limbs"
That sucks.......anyways.
"When all medical personnel, first responders, teachers, school staff, people who live and work in congregate residences (including assisted living and nursing homes), and those in the population who are at high risk of  hospitalization and death due to age and/or underlying conditions who are willing to be vaccinated have been, then we can open schools universally with all of the attendant precautions to prevent or reduce transmission. Doing so before then will result in overwhelmed hospital systems all over the place - which threatens everyone's lives, including those of babies and children - and a rate of community spread that increases the risk even higher than it currently is of creating hosts for mutations that could leave us in an utterly disastrous place. At any point, we could get a mutation that allows the virus to completely escape the vaccines we currently have and/or one that allows the virus to seriously target young people, including children.

I'm not trying to be Pollyanna here. Yes, some kids will not be OK long-term - they will be left with effects that linger and have bearing on their long-term functioning. (There are always kids that are not OK long-term, unfortunately, even when we're not in a pandemic.) But - we can't be a society that demands that others actually die to prevent that. As long as those kids are alive, there is hope that with support and help over the course of their lives, they will be able to build lives of meaning and purpose. Dead people have no such hope."
Because those people die and dead people don't need vaccines?

"My father took my 2 younger brothers and my sister to the lake when I was 16. They all had life jackets, but he figured since he was in the Navy he didn't need one or some stupid shit.

I just remember bobbing around and going from getting my face barely above water, and then sinking back down and seeing my brother swimming up to me and the feeling of relief.

"This is what FDR said:

""In my Inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By ""business"" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living.

[Throughout industry, the change from starvation wages and starvation employment to living wages and sustained employment can, in large part, be made by an industrial covenant to which all employers shall subscribe. It is greatly to their interest to do this because decent living, widely spread among our 125, 000,000 people, eventually means the opening up to industry of the richest market which the world has known.](http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/odnirast.html)"""
"Yup seems pretty clear to me. Armed Robbery and assault with a deadly weapon.

"&gt;200 out of 1.8 million stolen guns is not helping your argument. 

You're comparing an annual number (200) versus a 6 year figure. You're comparing a number that represents a ""sliver"" of police departments (which total about 900k law enforcement officers) to a population of more than 75 million gun owners with 300+ million firearms. 

There are 75 million civilian owners, and yet roughly 11k homicides by guns a year (mostly by people that are legally barred from owning, but I'll include them in the figure). There are 900k law enforcement officers and they kill roughly 1000 people a year. So statistically, cops kill more people with their guns than civilians (including the criminals that are not allowed to own them).

See how statistics work? Based on the statistics alone, perhaps we should disarm the police first. Of course I'm being facetious, but you're trying to use silly arguments to place blame on legal gun owners for the acts of criminals.

&gt;states that hand out guns to whoever wants them

Please tell me which states are handing out guns so I can go pick one up. Even in NYC, anyone that wants a gun can get one (even with all the hurdles and cost associated with it). Those that can't legally own a gun in NYC will face the exact same roadblocks in other states as well. But do provide me more of your insight into how that can't possibly be true."

Second, there was no incident until they were leaving the plane. The daughter and mother were perfectly fine during the entirety of the flight.    

Third, their ticket had them board in the last group and find their own seats.   

Fourth, the unhelpful flight attendants who told the mother to ask other passengers if her daughter could sit with her could have also asked her if she was her daughter rather than involve the police.   

Fifth, the 10 year old black girl was upset because two armed cops confronted her and her mother in a world where it’s not unreasonable for a ten year old black girl to be concerned around a couple of armed cops.  

Sixth, the police had not dropped the case and had called to follow up on the report ten days later.

Also, turns out the OP who said “we was” is a white dude so he’s wrong and the person correcting him is right."
Can I report this to Dan Patrick as voter fraud?
I think we can both agree that what would be political suicide for Trump is not the same as what would be political suicide for Pritzker.
People with no reason or background were allowed to control the VA due to paying a fee to Trumps club.
"Awww, is someone big mad I said something mean about welfare queens? McDonald’s and Amazon literally subsidize payroll with American tax dollars and you’re over here acting like I’m the one out of touch with reality. Take a seat big guy."
"Cannot think abstractly I see. He inferred if something used like “medicine” but is not called “medicine,” the it is not medicine. I simply disproved that logic."
"Trade him to his buddy Joe, they can shoot each other up with horse dewormer, fucking idiot"
"Unfortunately, that's not true.

Target _still_ carries these Hylands teething drops! Who is buying this crap?"
"I mean all of those things are about as useful as noting that a child trafficker would obviously have a kid with them, so the fact they were with their child is suspicious. It's the dumbest thing I've read on this thread."
Answer the question.
"20 year prison term. His father should immediately resign, there is no telling how many other children he employed to get elected."
"""I'm 30 minutes older now, am I eligible?"""
"Lemme guess you get all of your news from Facebook or Memes. Japan hasn’t even approved ivermectin as a Covid treatment. Making vaccines political is laughable.

"Hey, that’s not a fair comparison. He hasn’t sent unsolicited dick pix yet… that we know of."
Yeah theres no way his agent precleared this. My God what a disaster of an interview.
I read that as 'debunking physics' and it completely inverted your meaning in my head!
In other news scientists have discovered that water is wet.
"Now, let's not disparage moonshine and whisky here."
Idk im just going by what he said himself

"Bullshit he's allergic. It's extraordinarily rare and the ingredients are so common the massive restrictions it places on him would already have come out. 

If he was, he'd have a medical exemption. 

And he just now says this? Along with all his other stupid shit?

He's a lying sack of shit. 

Further, unless he's a young woman, he's not in the risk group for the J&amp;J vaccine."
"Correction: Mississippi had the most lynchings (581). Georgia was a close 2nd (531).

"I don't think the situations are comparable. There is an implicit understanding that handing your kid to someone premedical emergency that it's still your child.

When you are evacuating a country and you are making a decision to hand off custody, which is exactly what was going on, you may not have the ability to get them back. Maybe intentional or maybe unintentional, but you are in fact surrendering your child in the moment to another government halfway across the world with no paperwork or agreement that they will even have the ability to find you.

This is why soldiers and the military don't like these silent agreement refugee taking. It's always a mess for these exact reasons."
"Nah, just make that: racist people."
Man who throws football for living is an idiot.
Have you considered that he is probably lying?

"Pretty sure it's against set rules, the armorers lawyer is saying it was sabotage."
You disproved nothing. The only thing you did here was show that you don’t know the definition of homeopathy.
