"One of the most enjoyable stories I've read in some time. Captain Jack Aubrey was a fascinating character. You just wanted him to succeed - to capture the Spanish vessel, to gain the respect of his men, to gain the respect of the Admiral. The book is set during the Napoleonic Wars, and it was interesting to see all the Kings ships were nothing but glorified pirates, capturing all vessels they could on the open seas. The book also strongly reminded me of my sailing lessons from last summer - I still had to look a lot of words up, but I remembered ones like leeward and abeam. Makes me want to go sailing!",4,4,4
"A hilarious and book from Tina Fey - definitely worth listening to over audio as she reads it herself. She makes fun of herself a lot, adds lots of light humor, and of course shares TMI. The most interesting bit was hearing the behind the scenes of Saturday Night Live, and how she was a joke writer there for 3 years before they gave her a role on the show, which was only doing the news. Her breakout occurred after she had already left for 30 Rock, when she did the Sarah Palin impersonation. Tina is clearly an example of someone who has worked long and hard to get where she is.",4,3,4
Highly recommended if you are curious about Manic-depressive disease. A fascinating and even very well written insight from a woman who is both a Psychiatrist who treats it and suffers from it. She was very brave and very poetic in writing this book.,4,3,3
"This story had so much promise! And I love Whitney G. 's writing style; in fact, Turbulence was one of my favorite books this year. This was a cute, fast read BUT several typos later and a heroine who sends sexually explicit emails from her work account and I'm out. Moving on with high hopes for this author's next book. Call me an eternal optimist.",4,3,4
"Another warm, romantic and totally hot story! I have a confession: I am addicted to Alexa Riley's books! They are quick, sexy, and always well-written. The heroes are devoted to their women and the heroines love every second of it. There's always a HEA in the world of Alexa Riley!",4,3,4
"Seriously, Skye Warren can pack more feeling and vivid description into a short story than some authors can in 350 pages. I immediately connected with the lovely young Erin and the object of her desire, Mr. Blake Morris. This wonderful, short erotic story is a total turn-on but is very touching at the same time. Read it, you will absolutely love this sweet and steamy story. Beauty Touched the BeastSkye Warren",4,3,4
"I was surprised at how much I liked this book because I don't usually gravitate towards science fiction. It wasn't perfect, but I did overall really enjoy it! I was pleasantly surprised in the fact that for a male writer, Yancey writes in the female perspective very well--and he writes some pretty kick ass female characters, so if you appreciate that as much as I do, check this book out. The only thing I didn't like about it was the fact that a lot of the characters were so emotionally detached. None of the feelings seemed genuine, and the characters barely mourned at all over the deaths of their loved ones. It was mostly about action--a lot of times in an in your face and blunt way--not so much about feelings.",4,3,4
"I have endless respect and admiration for David Levithan. His books are so meaningful and so beautiful. I loved getting to see a different perspective on Every Day, since it was one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. While this book wasn't quite as perfect as the original (and I never expected it to be), Rhiannon's POV still proved to be insightful and was written with the same literary excellence. I will say that I was uncomfortable with the amount of infidelity in this book, because I don't believe that cheating on a partner is ever really justified. I think now more than ever, I really need the sequel to A's story.",4,3,4
"Absolutely captivating. Once you begin reading, you won't be able to put it down. One tells the story of a set of conjoined twins who, against all odds, have made it into their teens. Homeschooled for their entire lives, hard times have forced the family to send them to public school for the first time. The fact that One is written completely in free verse poetry adds power and emotion to the story and pulls the reader in. One tells a heartbreaking but important story of acceptance and love that is perfect for fans of The Fault in Our Stars, If I Stay, and All the Bright Places.",4,3,4
"This book was everything I could have wanted from one of Anderson's books and more! It was written in incredibly captivating and melodic prose. There were lines and pages that made me stop and close the book and just sit in awe of how amazing her writing was. The plot and the concept of the story was as heartbreaking as Speak and Wintergirls, but as always Anderson's characters are strong, resilient, witty-- the kind of characters you root for. I definitely would recommend this book to any fan of realistic fiction!",4,3,4
"I do not normally like historical fiction, but this beautiful work is artful and insightful. The pace of the writing and the glimpses of life in revolutionary England and Belgium feel very real and alive, like a Merchant and Ivory movie or an old BBC Masterpiece Theater piece. And the portrait of Margaret of Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, her experiences, her thinking and her writing are poignantly expressed in elegant, thoughtful sketches. I am also reading Daniel Boorstin's The Discoverers and the personages in Stuart England and the age of Newton also show up here, coming delightfully alive. This is going on my favorites list.",4,3,4
"A fun adventure tale that is a tad too droll and proper for my tastes. Millet's brand of humor is cut and dried--more of the tongue-in-cheek jokes of Erma Bombeck than the twist of the angry knife humor of Deborah Eisenberg, David Rakoff or Sam Lipsyte. If you are going to criticize using humor, go for the big laugh, is my philosophy. Still, entertaining enough to be a solid summer read, a pleasant time passer.",4,3,3
"A charming, tea drinker's tale about the furtive and futile impulses of a collection of aging British upper-crusters and their household help; a collection of their scheming, their fears, their denials, and their consideration. Perhaps quite cutting edge in its day. Spoiler Alert: Everyone dies in the end.",4,3,4
"Very well-written; excellent character development. In several spots, the extended time spent completing the book (which Johnson refers to in her Acknowledgments) is evident: for example, Facebook no longer has ""walls,"" there are absolutely no public telephones available anywhere in 2017, and my biggest personal complaint,  no teacher, especially not a 23 year old college grad, should need ""cyberbullying"" announced to them as if the term is new or unfamiliar. Overall, an excellent view inside the lives, minds, and hearts of teens today.",4,3,3
"I haven't stayed up until 5am to finish a book in a while - it felt good. This was a great murder-mystery thriller, and more interesting as it's set in Sweden and deals with journalists, corporations, and hackers. Good stuff!",3,2,2
"This should be 3.5 stars. I really enjoyed it, but found it all kind of random and leading nowhere. That being said, it was very imaginative and entertaining. Hrun the Barbarian was one of my favorites, as was anything the Luggage did.",3,4,3
"Loved every second, and didn't want it to end, so I had to find a book store and buy the next two! Its a Harry Potter reading level and similar type fantasy story, but sometimes thats what you need on a long flight to NYC for the holidays! I think as a child we all daydreamed about alternate worlds, so I love how thats the basis for the book. Thinking about all the permutations of how things could turn out differently is kinda fun :) I think if I had a Daemon I would hope she'd settle on being a lynx.",3,2,3
DNF. Gave up at around 20%. Way too many grammatical and editing issues for me to continue. I also couldn't get past the simplistic and degrading nickname that Vicious had for the heroine (he called her Help) That was offensive to me. Moving on.,3,2,3
"Had the pleasure to read an early copy, and it is just a beautiful story!! A Love So Tragic is a gorgeous second-chance romance. Nic and Peyton have a passionate connection but a very rocky road to their own HEA that is emotional, sometimes painful and very, very REAL. I loved the ""rawness"" of it all. More to come closer to release day!",3,4,4
"So I really don't think you can go wrong with an Alexa Riley book. Thief was over-the-top steamy and sweet, and had lots of action, too! This is a wonderful escapist bit of erotica when you want a hot Alpha and a guaranteed HEA.",3,2,3
"I love an erotic suspense and dark romance as much as the next person but this book just didn't quite do it for me. I literally felt dropped right into the middle of a story that had already begun, which was very disorienting. While many readers are raving about this book, for me there was no connection between the main characters and many of their actions felt mechanical, and the story, formulaic. I still would love to read the other books by this author, because their story lines sound very intriguing. Giving credit here for a very strong, kick-ass heroine, and a surprising ending. (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)",3,4,4
"Many readers loved this book but it just wasn't for me. I am a fan of dark romance, dark erotica, romantic thrillers, the whole nine yards so the darker elements were fine for me but I just didn't connect with the main characters. I definitely suggest giving this book a try because the story has a lot of promise but there were just too many character and plot inconsistencies for me to become invested in the story. I will read the author's other books because they sound very interesting and readers whose opinion I trust have really loved her writing.",3,2,3
"3.5 Stars Kate McCarthy is a favorite author of mine but surprisingly this book just did not do it for me. Although the book features a very strong heroine and and a talented but tortured hero, which I loved, the plot of this book fell flat for me and the so-called scandal was absolutely not scandalous in my eyes at all. Lots of readers fell in love with this book so definitely give this one a try and judge for yourself. I adore Kate McCarthy (Redemption is one of my top favorites) and look forward to her next book!",3,4,4
"Devil's Game is thrilling, sexy and funny, and I absolutely devoured every yummy word. Oh, and I love Joanna's kick-ass heroine, Em! This is Book Three in the Reaper's MC Series, and has little bit different feel than the other books in the series. Devil's Game is about family, loyalty and yes, love, with all of the delicious sexy times that I love from Joanna's books. I fell in love with these characters and highly recommend Devil's Game!",3,1,3
"There is nothing quite like a Tessa Bailey book for a good hot dose of dirty-talking Alpha. A well written story, smoking hot sex scenes and characters I actually cared make Staking His Claim a must-read. I absolutely love Matt Donovan! And since I do judge books by their covers, I also give an A+ to this steamy cover for Staking His Claim. Highly recommended. (ARC provided by the publisher for an honest review.)",3,1,3
"Quite a good read. For once an ending seemed well handled--only one small piece seemed extraneous. Some excellent character development. I had forecast a totally different ending, and mine would have worked well also, but this one was better. I find that I enjoy being right in forecasting the ending, and I also enjoy being surprised by being wrong when it is well done.",3,2,3
"4.5 stars rounded up to 5. I devoured this book. The writing was gorgeous and the book was very atmospheric and had this supernatural/eerie sense to it (at least imo) throughout. Unforunately, I thought the last 1/4 or even 1/3 of the book was rather lackluster (I give the first half of the book 5 stars and the last 1/3 like, maybe 2.5 stars) - the ending also left me feeling unsatisfied, but because I enjoyed the previous parts so much, I decided to round my rating up to 5 stars instead of 4. I have the distinct feeling that not much actually happened in this book, but the characters and the setting and mood were just so well written I didn't really care. I look forward to reading the Goldfinch.",3,2,3
"Considering most of the reviews I've seen about this book so far have been so-so, I really enjoyed it! I will say that I'm not at all a fan of scary movies and I tend to get scared very easily, so this may not be as exciting to hard core horror fans, but if you're like me and you want to dip your feet into the genre, I think this was great. Most people also didn't like the fact that the murderer gets revealed fairly early on, but the book didn't focus on who was commiting the crimes, but why they were commiting them, and I actually really enjoyed that aspect.",3,4,4
"This is the first graphic novel that I've read, so I don't have anything else to compare this book to, but I thought it was pretty spectacular! I really loved the art. I thought the story was so powerful and with such an amazing cast of characters and I loved the symbolism. It wasn't predictable at all, I was constantly surprised by what would happen next as I read. I picked this book up on a whim to try something different and I am so glad that I did!",3,4,4
"I honestly don't understand what people don't like about this book. I was expecting it to be terrible, espically because I find that I'm often not satisfied with the endings to series, but I loved every minute of this one. It was definitly creepier and more graphic, but I thought that it did a great job of explaining all of the shit that went down in the first two books. I honestly wasn't expecting to get that much closure. This was truly a spectacular series and a great ending to a great series.",3,2,2
"Mosquitoland tells it's story from a voice like no other I've read before. Our main character Mim is honest, frank, and in your face from page one and you can't help but instantly fall in love with her for it. David Arnold writes in one of the most accurately teen voices I have read in YA to date. As we travel with Mim on her cross-country journey, we are confronted with heartbreak, tackle important issues, and manage to laugh along the way. Towards the middle I felt the story start to lag a little bit, and I'm not completely on board with the way things ended, but this is an incredibly strong debut from Arnold and I look forward to reading his second book and any future books to come.",3,4,4
"After a bit of a slow start with Nine Stories, this volume shows that Angela Carter can write. She wields a broader vocabulary than any writer I can name and can write sentences that flow clear and fast. They sparkle with wit and insight. The subject matter, retold fairy tales with an erotic twist, feels a bit aged, like the darkly lit, wood paneled men's club interiors of chaste Sixties Playboy photoshoots, and there are quite a few wolves, which imagery feels overused. The libido-on-the-loose vibe pervades these stories, but the feminist messaging, if any, went right over my head.",3,4,4
"Sad yet heart-warming all at once--well written and an easy read An extremely well told tale, with an historic background that brings on the melancholy. Bad people are everywhere, sometimes right in front of you--but the most painful scenes are lightly told. The writing is very smooth and somewhat formulaic, so it is possible to skip ahead to the dialogue and not miss any story point. This enabled me to power through in 15 minute subway ride segments over the course of about ten days.",3,2,3
"I think this is the best of Aimee Bender. A contemplative exploration of the life of one L.A. family from the daughter's point of view. There are fantastical elements here, but my dull mind was able to see the beauty and insight of them.",3,2,3
"Good book for when you are sick in bed, or on a subway commute. Douglas Adams has a fine, Monty Pythonesque sense of humor. Its over fast, but apparently there is another one if you are interested. Spoiler alert: I would like to share a point where I did not LOL, but did in fact laugh out loud so hard that the subsequent coughing fit cured me of my bronchitis, viz. Question: How many roads must a man walk down? Indeed.",3,2,2
"This novel got to me on a blood sugar level, it echoes down your spine, you can feel it in your mitochondria. The writing is fresh, quick and hard. The pace is fast, and the pressure builds throughout. The movie was great, but there is a presence in the book that you do not get in the movie, and scenes in the book that are not in the movie. It hits you over the head and then it saves you. The one blot is the racist language, which I would like to believe is just a period character and not the author.",3,4,3
"3.5 stars A well-plotted story that reveals complex characters layer by ever-deepening layer, much as one might come to know persons in the real world, All the Missing Girls was a satisfying read. Although the reverse chronology worked for me for the most part, I found it annoying just past the midpoint of the book for 50 pages or so. However, the plot was compelling enough that I moved past that section/emotion - I'm not sure if that experience was related to the content or simply my tolerance - and regained the sense of being engaged and invested.",3,2,4
"I rated this book as 4 stars because of quality of writing. Parry has drawn her characters well, follows the ""show, don't tell"" principle, employs realistic dialogue, and her plot development is impressively intricate for any novel - but even more so considering this is her debut. I can't honestly say that I enjoyed the novel as several thematic elements are difficult to read about. Manhattan's underbelly in 1895 is a hard place to visit, even in one's imagination.",3,4,4
Numerous people in publishing have told me this will be the book of the year.,2,1,1
"Despite having a name that sounds like its a chic-book, this was a pretty sweet western novel. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",2,1,1
"I read this after I went fly fishing for the first time, and it was pure gold. A fantastic story.",2,1,1
One of my favorites from Grisham. The movie was good to (but of course not as good as the book),2,1,1
"I read this classic twice in high school. Its hard to like books you read in high school, but this one stood out - couldn't tell you why anymore :)",2,1,1
Man I wish I hadn't read this yet so I could enjoy it again.,2,1,1
"I know this book is supposed to be evil as its horribly inaccurate, but I had a lot of fun reading it, so I'm still giving it 4 stars. (sorry jacques)",2,1,1
4.5 Stars! LOVED this sexy-sweet and romantic story!! I fell in love with the characters in this book and absolutely LOVE this author!! I knew from the first page that I would love this romance. Highly recommend. Full review to follow.,2,1,2
"For some reason, this story did not hold my interest. Stopped at about 35% but will pick this one up again later. I usually devour KA books but I'm moving on.",2,1,1
4.5 STARS! What a beautiful and VERY different story!! Not at all what I expected! Full review to come soon.,2,1,1
"I am officially obsessed with Alexa Riley's books!! The Mechanic was a delicious, smutty, sizzling hot story with some of THE dirtiest talkers around. These books are like palate-cleansers in between the main course. Highly recommended!",2,1,2
Writing is all over the place. My first Megan Hart book. No clear point of view.,2,3,2
"Kristen did it again! The story of Frankie and Benny was just simply absolutely AMAZING!!! I could not put it down, so much so when finished I picked up the other burg books and started re-reading it to remember all the burg history. So if you haven't yet read it be sure to do sooo !!!",2,1,2
"I must say that so far I loved all of Kriten's books but I REALLY Enjoyed reading the story of Chase & Faye!! It was the perfect ending for Chace. I loved watching Faye and Chace's relationship blossom and become what they both dreamed it would. It was very cute that they both had been in love with each other for years and they finally got what they wanted. I would definitely recommend this book, once I started reading it I could barely put it down... so it's THAT good!",2,3,3
"I had read that it was merely a repeat of The Hunger Games, but decided to read it anyway. And I am glad I did. The revolutionary potential of Katniss' actions has been noted and promoted a new level of oversight and punishment. It read equally as well as the first one.",2,3,2
"Some very interesting character development, an attention holding plot. Some historic information about World War II women prisoners (though the country was changed). Once the main character became an entrepreneur, it became unbelievable, but still a fun read.",2,3,3
"Two things appealed to me about this book. First, I am fascinated by animals learning human language, had read about Nim Chimsky long ago and was fascinated by the use of sign language with animals. I appreciated the notes at the end leading to research backing the novel actions and to the comment that most of the ape - human conversation was based on real conversations, although the book was fiction. Second, it was a real page turner with twists and turns. Some events I could figure out ahead and some surprised me, a nice balance.",2,3,3
I'm currently reading Clockwork Angel and I'm liking it it is very different from the Mortal Instruments and Clockwork Princess is almost coming so I better finish the first two books (probably might borrow the second book from my friend I am also borrowing the first book from another friend),2,1,2
"I totally came into this book expecting a cliche, cheesy romance. I honestly thought the book was going to be about the MC dating twenty different boys during the summer. Luckily, I was wrong.",2,1,2
"(This, and the whole series) Needs a re-read. This was my shit in middle school but all the hate has distorted my views of this book series (phenomena, really) and I need a refresh to form my own opinion. Thus, I've abstained from rating any books in this series until I reread them again. Back when I first read them, they all would have been 5 stars. After I thought it was ""cool"" to hate on this, they'd be 2 stars. The new rating will reflect my current opinion.",2,1,1
"Since the first book fell flat, I was expecting the same from the sequel. In the beginning, it was just that. By the middle though, I was thoroughly enraptured by the book. It was VERY predictable and I predicted the ""villains"" since practically the beginning, still, that fact did not diminish my enjoyment of the book.",2,3,3
"This book is all about female empowerment while also tackling many subjects such as racism, stereotyping, and sexuality. Seriously, it covers EVERYTHING. Feminism ftw. I like how it doesn't take itself too seriously though.",2,3,2
"I was gonna give this book 3 stars, but I decided on 2 because justifying attempted rape is never o.k. I felt like this book set out to be one of those deep, pretentious books that set out to give you life lessons. I will admit that it did a good job of not being pretentious. It was extremely emotionally manipulative, however.",2,4,3
"It was an easy, quick read. Heard some good things about it so I'd thought I'd check it out. Was pretty disappointed after I read the book. It isn't all that great and there were many times where I just wanted to strangle the main character for being so slow and dumb and unable to comprehend the events that were clearly happening right in front of her. I didn't understand where the book was going with the romance, one moment one guy would be just friends with her and then all of sudden, he suddenly decides that he is in love with her. Overall, just like my rating shows, the book was o.k.",2,3,3
"Ending happened a little fast for me, but I loved the style and felt like the telling of the story was creative. Stylistically, one of the more interesting and engaging books I've read this year.",2,3,2
"This book was everything. I actually think I liked it a little more than the first one. (Only a little, because the first one was amazing, but still.) I never thought I would like this series as much as I do now. How these books manage to pack in so much action and create such great characters in the format that they do is incredible to me.",2,1,2
"A less than riveting examination of the internal psychology of two messed up kids. Good description of some interiors of Paris and interiors of a ruthless couple and their creepy mother in law. The BBC did a film version of this which I cannot forget 25 years later. The book is decent, but my mind will never forget the images of the film version.",2,3,2
Everything we believe about pirates comes from this story. Yo-ho-ho! And Long John Silver is a character like no other--except perhaps the Devil himself in Paradise Lost. Rip-roaring adventure!,2,1,2
"After the monastery scene, at the point of encounter between the father's servant and the middle son, the narrative engine kicks into high gear and doesn't stop until the end. Which ... makes it sounds as if I only care about plot... No, I just want to encourage people to read it. This is a novel of real, finely drawn characters, and ideas that are rarely considered today-- just cheapened to some UTube debate. Anywho, its a wonderful book.",2,3,2
"Note: This book contains very graphic descriptions of violence to women. It's well-plotted, highly suspenseful and fast-paced. However, I object strongly to the gratuitous descriptions that in no way enhance the story.",2,3,2
"Recommended reading to understand what is going on in middle america, and possibly better explain why Trump won. http://www.npr.org/2016/11/09/5013826...",1,2,2
Great book about Galileo from the perspective of his daughter.,1,2,1
"4.5 stars, scorching hot sex scenes and great characters but the grammar took away from my enjoyment of the story.",1,2,2
"Five stars to Sempre. Deeply felt, moving love story of loss and redemption. Carmine and Haven will fill your dreams.",1,2,2
AWESOME SEXY READ!!! Only problem I found with it was that it ended a bit suddenly and I feel like I was left hanging. Not in a cliffhanger kind of way but I just wanted a bit more on their HEA... But other than that it was a great read.,1,2,2
"AWESOME READ!!! I loved to story of Aiden and Emma. It was a little predictable but in a very fun, easy read sort of way. can't wait to start reading the proposal!",1,2,2
"Another end of a great series. A great way to end the series, too. ;_______; Everything was properly sequenced and I never get tired of Marie's alternate POVs unlike other books where it feels like there's only one narrator speaking even if there is two. ((Also, am I the only one who's interested in Antarctica??? That place is so cool))",1,2,2
It started off slow and it didn't really go anywhere until near the end. The romance was predictable and some twists were o.k.,1,2,2
"It was o.k. Maybe it's just me but I was annoyed at how Ethan had to mention his undying, unyielding, eternal love for Lena practically EVERY.OTHER.PAGE. Like, OKAY, WE GET IT ETHAN. YOU LOVE LENA. WE KNOW. WE'VE READ THREE WHOLE BOOKS ABOUT YOUR GUYS' LOVE PRIOR.",1,2,1
"I swear this took me like a month to read...still, it was seriously amazing. Heathcliff is so unlikable but you just can't help empathizing with him",1,2,2
"After 10,000 years I have finally finished this book. There was a lot of telling not showing.",1,2,1
"Don't read in public. You are going to cry. There is no point fighting this, they're good tears.",1,2,1
Third read through. Still can't make it all the way through without calling friends who haven't even read the book to ugly cry.,1,2,1
** spoiler alert ** Paranormal. 3 different modes of death. Character dead.,1,2,1
"This started out really well, with magic, mystery and intrigue but then it devolved into an insta-all consuming love story and I...Just....Couldn't.",1,2,1
3.5 - 4 Stars! Fans of strong Alpha heroes and military romance will like this one. There is lots and lots of swoony romance and a very dramatic plotline. If you want to lose yourself in a romantic story then this is the book is for you.,,2,2
Please please please don't let there be typos in the finished book like there are in the Goodreads summary!,,1,1
4 1/2 beautiful stars. Loved it. Review to follow.,,1,1
"Liked this better than the first book. This is speculation since I haven't read the 3rd book yet, if the author makes it so Seth was actually just using her I will be angry because I HATE when authors do that. I hate when they take a seemingly sweet, genuine guy and turns him into a douche so the reader will root for the other guy. UGH.",,1,1
"This started off with a bang, absolutely hilarious! This series should probably be read in order and I will defintiely read the first book to see what all the fuss is about. Tapping Her is a super-quick, very dirty and very funny bit of romantic comedy, with some laugh-out-loud moments and a great male POV. There is nothing emotional or angsty about this book and it's just a little something to pick up in between heavier reads. Not too much of a plot here, so don't expect War and Peace.",4,4,4
"One of the most amazing things about this book was that in spite of knowing the ending, it was suspenseful through and through. The second amazing thing is that it explained rowing to someone who had no clue (me) and little interest in sports in such a way that it was clear but not too much. The story of the road to the Olympics is told mostly from the perspective of Joe Rantz;however, as he requested, it is told in the context of ""the boat""--more than the shell that they propelled with oars, ""the boat"" is the spirit of the team working together in perfect harmony. The physical boat too is a character, and Pocock, its maker, stands out as one filled with wisdom about people as well as rowing and boat building. The story is told in the context of the Depression, the Dust Bowl, and the drums of encroaching World War II. Joe's surmounting of personal struggles as well as economic is admirable.",4,4,4
"This is the first Erdrich novel told from one character's point of view throughout that I have read, and it is well done. Erdrich uses a few sneaky ways to get other peoples' information into the story, but they are believable (even the dream stories). I was glad to see familiar names. Nanapush has a significant role, and others make a cameo appearance (Father Damien, a character from The Bingo Palace, and two other families whose names I recognized but can't think of now). There is an interesting balance between the tense plot moments and boyish day-to-day moments as the plot moves inevitably onward to a satisfying ending. We really get to know the major characters, and I found most quite likeable.",4,4,4
"This book left me dead inside. Even though this book is clearly a retelling about the Queen of Hearts from Alice and Wonderland, I'm a little shell shocked by the ending of this book. I will say that I read the original Alice's Adventures In WonderLand and Through the Looking Glass in preparation for this book, and oh my goodness that was the best decesion I could have ever made. If I thought I was impressed by Meyer's ability to craft retellings when I read the Lunar Chronicles, that was truly nothing after reading this book. The amount of references to the original text and the way she crafts this story to make sense with the originals is absoultly amazing. If you aren't very familiar with WonderLand, I highly recommend reading Lewis Carroll's work before diving into this.",4,4,4
"This book was so original; I've never read anything like it. The symbolism blew my mind and was absolutely beautiful, especially the scene describing the tapestry. There were plot twists in this book that I could have never seen coming and couldn't stop reading to find out what would happen next. I had some small problems, and it realistically is probably more like a 4.5 for me, but there were parts that made me so happy that I just had to bump it up to 5 stars.",4,4,4
"I think I'm finally really getting into this series now! I have a lot more respect and interest for the characters after this book--finally. Unfortunately, I found the first half of this book really slow and that's why I couldn't give if five stars, but the second half was definitely worth five on its own. I can't wait to read the next book now! I also was not a fan of the fact that we were finally introduced to an LGBTQA+ character in this series, only to have him killed off for dramatic effect. I know there is a lot of death in this series, and usually I love that it keeps the plot interesting and keeps me guessing about what will happen next, but I was really excited to finally have that diversity in this story and I don't think she should've taken it in that direction",4,4,4
"As far as trilogy wrap-ups go I think this one finished quite nicely! It had an overall happy ending but with enough loss and heartbreaking moments to make it believable. Beautifully written as always (I think that's to be expected from any of Oliver's books). The only thing that I wished would've been done differently is that the ending felt very rushed to me. I felt like majority of the book could've been sped up to give her more time to drag out the ending and make it more detailed and give us more or an epilogue, or she could've just made the book longer to wrap it up a little bit more. I thought the way that it ended was beautiful, I just would have liked a little bit more.",4,4,4
"This is the best book I've read in a really really long time. I could feel myself slipping into a reading slump and I'm so thankful I picked this book up when I did because it managed to engage me like no other book I've read in a seriously long time. The best thing about this book is that it's so completely unique and different than anything I've ever read. Usually, I'm always drawing connections in my mind between books while I'm reading but this book really created a world of its own. I had absolutely no idea where the plot was headed or how things would resolve and I didn't see any of the plot twists coming, which is really rare for me because I've found that lately I usually always can tell where books are headed and see the plot twists coming before the main character. Despite the very dark tone of this book, Sabaa Tahir's writing style is so elegant and the themes and characters in this book were so beautiful.",4,4,4
"I put off reading this book for almost a year, and after finally reading it, I didn't find myself pleasantly surprised. It was pretty much exactly what I expected it to me. For one thing, the style of writing really bothered me (there was too much passive voice and it didn't suit the tense at all) and I disliked almost all of the characters. There were so many of them that you didn't really get close to any as an individual. I didn't really care what happened to the characters or the overall ending of the book, and was unclear on the whole concept of endgame to begin with. Even though they said the word Endgame almost 100 times, they never really clearly gave a description as to what it was.",4,4,4
"One of the best histories of any age I have ever read. Graves brings to life the remarkable awfulness of life within the Roman Empire, and demonstrates with alarming exactness how bad people can be, given motive and opportunity. The maxim that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely is demonstrated here in spades. Paranoia and bloodlust within the few ruling families of ancient Italy are rampant, but the level-headed Claudius holds your faith that good might ultimately ""triumph"" (i.e., until the whole thing goes downhill again--why can't human society ever achieve sustained equilibrium?). I can understand now how Italy tolerated the buffoonish Prime Minister Berlusconi for so long. Compared with their Imperial past, his antics were a walk in the park.",4,4,4
"The pace is slower than Hobbit and there is much more scenery, but the story somehow manages to hold one's interest. There is an adventure underneath the overgrowth; and perhaps there is some use for this surfeit of nature--like the green of the surrounding garden, a comfortable home (as per Japanese architecture) is not complete if it does not interact with its environment. The power of the Ring is well depicted--my sons would sometimes scream in warning as Frodo fingered the ring, ""Don't put on the ring!!!"" Thank you for the memories, J.R.R.",4,4,4
"A sad tale of love, where the lovers do not understand their own motives, or, if they do, they fail to listen to them. The young woman should have married the man she loved rather than the one who came from England. The man treats marriage as a box to check on his life menu. The locals are watching helplessly as this marriage inevitably hits the rocks. Some really beautiful writing in here.",4,4,4
"This well written update to Catcher in the Rye depicts the confusion of high schoolers trying to find their way into adulthood. At first I mistook ""wall flower"" as code for a gay character, but it turns out that the author character is only a wimp, a soft-hearted crybaby, who I am surprised is not beaten, or at least ostracized by the end of the story, because that is the likely result of such a personality at my high school, which pre-dates the era in which this was written. And Ohio, my home state, is not far, or different, from Pennsylvania. Of course, he has to be soft-hearted in order to get away with some of the scenes he is witness to here. Nonetheless, he does a decent job of teasing out the small hypocrisies, the animal instincts, and most of all the sadness of the whole high school experience.",4,4,4
"Principle thesis: black Americans (and, by extension, any minority) might in actual result have been better off over the last 50 years with some form of (voluntary?) segregation, to the extent that such segregation could fire an angst to excel against the cracker powers. The thesis is troubling to the alluvial plain of the post-Civil Rights movement in America's political-culture, but the writing itself is a blazing scrim of hip-hop cultural riffing that leaves no bleeding heart do-gooder unscathed, no conservative talking head unsullied, no cultural sellout untouched, and no stone (or Molotov cocktail) unthrown. That is to say, it is very sharp, fun, and painful to read. Rated PG-13.",4,4,4
"A creepy Lolita-like tale brought wittily up to date by a very sharp writer. Although some of the scenes are a touch too graphic for my tastes, the unfailing narcissism and blindness of the protagonist propel the story and the humor forward through increasingly you-have-got-to-be-kidding plot developments. The pages are filled with insightful, quirky, dark humor. And there is a sadness flowing through the narration that is barely visible until the very last scenes when there is a sense of boundless devastation. Although in the story there is only one prosecution, in the course of the narrative, everyone, society included, is indicted.",4,4,4
"Egan shows brilliance in all categories of insight and description in this wonderful novel about turn of the century America. From the unbalanced professor of history of American industry to the soul sellers of the dot com bubble, all ring true and melancholic. The sadness of the passage of time and the strangeness of the existential experience, themes she revisits in Goon Squad, are starting to develop here.",4,4,4
"Many of these stories are effused with the lingering emotional aftermath of the unspoken war just ended. An ineffable sense of mourning plays through the words and actions of broken or confused ex-soldiers interacting with untouched civilians. Other stories carry a long melancholic nostalgia for childhood innocence, or a just a nostalgic melancholy, with small jokes and odd details to lighten the mood, a contrast of adult versus child, a crushed innocence. I very much liked the fact that the book cover is exactly the same design as the one that sat on my father's shelf when I was a boy, thus invoking in me my own melancholic nostalgia.",4,4,4
"Coupled with Flannery O'Connor's 'all the stories' collection, I was touring life in 1950s America. It was a bigoted, closeted, pleasant time, when people dressed well, read hard boiled pulp and didn't stick their noses in other people's business. I enjoyed greatly the description of all the little jobs that have irretrievably faded into history; the elevator operators, the western union offices, the man who has a job at a local bank in the next town, and having that job, makes enough to own a home in a nice neighborhood and raise a family. Where did these jobs go? Milton Friedman and his classical economist ilk sent them all away, across the borders and the oceans, because it's cheaper for the consumers, you know, those other people who have the good jobs, not the ones who are going to lose theirs when we throw their jobs onto the slag heap of there must be a better way. ... And I find that I have become a raving old coot.",4,4,4
"A quirky little (i.e., quickly read) novel, a sort of Twilight Zone of a situation, in which you can predict the direction fairly clearly, but it is creepy nonetheless. The direction of the story is much like The Lottery, a sort of community of oppression, but also fairly worn. The cousin, the interloper, is a practical business type, who can't stand quirkiness, who will not stand for oddity, and his appearance spells trouble. You sort of end up rooting for the person who seems like the source of the problem, but who is also somehow strangely innocent, as against the practical outsider, the snake who enters the garden and ruins everything.",4,4,4
"An amusing, entertaining book about one man's experience of failed middle class life, featuring a lot of weeping and epiphany on the part of the main character, and plenty of plot twists to keep it interesting. A nice summer or long train ride read (do you not ride trains where you live? You have my sympathy). The failure of the middle class life here is really about the failure of the U.S. economic system to maintain enough jobs to allow the dwindling American middle class to prosper, which it fails to notice when things seem good; the author gets in some licks on that account--a thoroughly enjoyable smack down of a few individuals symbolizing the group think, self-satisfaction, and collective delusion that started in the eighties, built up critical mass in the nineties, and after 2007 brought down the cloudburst of shit rain.",4,4,4
"A riff on 'ask and you shall receive, seek and ye shall find,' with a bit of ""use it or lose it,"" a boy who was searching for something ends up finding a bunch of gold. A materialist mantra disguised as a spiritual journey. Barbara Ehrenreich once observed that God the creator of the entire universe, could not possibly care whether a particular individual is rich or not. Jesus calls on people who would follow him to give up all their possessions. As for fans of The Alchemist, whatever makes you feel better, whatever gets you through the night, I suppose.",4,4,4
"Reading Ulysses is like ascending Everest. Establish a base camp at the beach, watch for the fireworks. Leave your fellow climbers for dead at the bar during the parade, and try to find that treacherous passage to the next level. The winds and weather are bad at times, particularly in the brothel, but veterans say that if you can make it to the soliloquy, you are home free. I teared up at the ending, in part from the beauty of the passage, in part from relief and shock at the pure achievement.",4,4,4
"I have read all but one of this author's previous novels and have really enjoyed them. From the beginning, this one seemed different in a way that I, initially, couldn't pinpoint. Certainly, an author can write a book that doesn't come together as well as her previous ones, but I have strong suspicions that this title was actually written earlier in Gudenkauf's career. The prose is stilted and amateurish compared to her other works, the characters are undeveloped, the plot thin and simplistic. Frequent proofreading errors also decreased the quality and my enjoyment of this book. Here's hoping that her next work is one that reflects her growth as a writer and her strengths as a storyteller.",4,4,4
"** spoiler alert ** I equally loved book 2, and am definitely hooked. I did feel it took a little while for them to get to sea, but I guess we can't bring in a love interest if we aren't on the land! My favorite thing by far was the Lively, and the descriptions of how fast she is and how much care the crew took keeping her a crack ship. Pride in what you do can be a great motivator. I also loved how Jack made them work the guns against all the batteries for practice.",3,3,3
"After seeing the movie (i liked it), and needing a fun read for a vacation, this was perfect. Like Jacques, I loved the explanation of Baccarat. My mental image of Vesper Lynd in the book is much prettier than the actress from the movie. Fleming's Bond is much more of a connoisseur than the movie Bond, and he takes great care in describing all the details of the things he enjoys - particularly his cigarettes, his food, his wine, and his car.",3,3,3
A really interesting novel that takes place in the future in a world where some people live in the metaverse (aka digital universe/internet) more than the real world. I don't remember it so well now but I do remember there being some really interesting tie-ins to ancient sumarian computers. That plus any book with a protagonist named Hiro Protagonist who wields badass japanese swords is just badass. Note: the MetaVerse is current being built now here: http://secondlife.com,3,3,3
Absolute unforgettable story of the power of a mother's love. The book has an uplifting and positive message even though the story itself is very grim. A must-read.,3,3,3
"4.5 Stars! WOW! What a gorgeous story! New-to-me author Emma Scott has written a beautifully-crafted, lyrical story with memorable characters and a simply beautiful love story. Full review to follow.",3,3,3
"An unblinking, unvarnished look inside the brutal life of a 70's MC gang. A perfect story with incredibly detailed references to South Florida in the 1970's. An ending that will take your breath away. Let the author stalking begin!",3,3,3
"An unblinking, unvarnished look inside the brutal life of a 70's MC gang. A perfect stroy with incredibly detailed referenced to South Florida in the 1970's. An ending that will take your breath away. Let the author stalking begin!",3,3,3
"Wonderful story that tackles a very emotional subject with great sensitivity and grace. There is no ""one size fits all"" when it comes to recovering from a traumatic assault. Loved Ryan and can't wait for his story.",3,3,3
"A powerfully written story that will take your breath away. You will not be able to tear yourself away from the story of Sophie and Ian. The writing is flawless and the character development perfect. Unforgettable first-kiss scene! Seriously, this book needs to be made into a movie. Put this at the top of your to-read list for 2013.",3,3,3
"It has been a while since I read it so I have forgotten details, but I remember mostly liking it. I wondered if amnesia would alter a personality as much as shown, but the author did do research. And the fiance's getting to know the new woman is a sort of reminder that we do change and that we shouldn't assume details about another.",3,3,3
"sometimes one needs a fluff read. But also need enough time to finish at the 'can't put down' stage. This one had too much prolonged history of Italy and Italian language detail in the beginning. Some was needed for setting and character development and to establish fear, but most felt like filler. Toward the second half it became a better read.",3,3,3
"After a sample of three, I see a pattern: lone character in a strange setting, establish the setting for a couple chapters, then gradually introduce other characters and fill in the past that got them to the strange state. I enjoyed references to the first volume. This second book had more slow moments than the first of the series, but when it was good it was very good. I am not yet sure what to make of the God's Garden religion. Sometimes it seemed excessive, other times wise.",3,3,3
"4.5 stars. Saying this book was amazing doesn't even begin to describe it. However, it lagged in some parts and it didn't really pull my heartstrings as much as I thought it would. I just can't bring myself to give it 5 stars but still an excellent read none the less.",3,3,3
"Original and refreshing, not to mention amazing. I love Marion's style of writing and I think I'm going to be eagerly awaiting ANY new book he writes. Even more stoked for the movie now. Beware of the explicit language in this book though. (Although the only cuss word that is constantly used in this book is the ""F"" word, it's used quite often.) Also, not gonna lie, there may have been oh, two or three parts (or 5+) that literally made me LOL and glad that I wasn't reading this in public... 5/5 (I would give it more stars if I could).",3,3,3
"3.5 stars. In my opinion, not as good as the first one. While it was a really quick read, nothing really happened. This book adds alternating povs, switching between Ky and Cassia each chapter but frankly, you definitely would not be able to differentiate between them unless you read the name at the beginning of the chapters. Ky doesn't have a distinct voice and sounds EXACTLY the same as Cassia. So there's that...plus, I really wanted to strangle some characters in this book.",3,3,3
"I liked it but I was a bit disappointed. Probably because I came into this book with high expectations. I think I liked this book more than I would have if I hadn't been required to analyze and answer questions on it for English class. All the symbols, motifs, and themes probably would have flown over my head.",3,3,3
"I liked it. I especially liked the beginning, the sarcastic, humorous tone of the book, and the action. It got kind of slow in the beginning/middle and the romance was sweet but  kind of sickly because, you know, it was basically necrophilia  . What I didn't like was how the beginning high school stuff was cliche, the assumption that all a guy has to do is ignore a girl to get her to fall for you, and the idea of a stereotypical white, blonde prom queen (although I actually liked the character). Also I don't know how to feel about the ending. But, there's a sequel so.",3,3,3
"Interesting to see how the different characters think about the Rebellion (I read it in Dutch, I think this is the word they use in the English version?) and how that changes (mainly with Xander) .",3,3,3
"This book was so exciting! I have never read anything like it. It is full of action, and Ursula Poznanski creates a game world that seems 'real' (not 'the world we live in'-real but 'this could be the setting of a fantasy book'-real). The plot surprised me and had me wondering all day: 'Could this be real?'",3,3,3
"This might be one of the first books that I have loved this much but was unable to read in one sitting. Or two sittings. It is lovely, dense in exactly the right ways, and deals with a lot of emotional situations in ways that are both unique and clever. Obviously, one of these situations is that of losing a friend emotionally and then actually, and how to resolve emotions of hatred and loss simultaneously. When I say it's dealt with uniquely, I mean that Vera is not somehow gifted with an emotional intelligence that would allow her to deal with this nimbly, and instead she simply dumb a**es through in a way that is relatable and cringe inducing.

"I was very apprehensive going into this book because I know that it is not told in a traditional style, but I ended up loving it. I will say that it was a little hard for me to keep everything straight in the beginning, but once I got into it and used to it I was fully emersed. I loved the characters in this book and even though I didn't think I was going to be able to see their personality come through with the way this was told, that was not the case at all. This book still managed to be hilarious and sad and beautiful even though it was literally just a compilation of files. It managed to completley take me by suprise and had me on the edge of my seat at multiple times throughout the story--not just at the end. I feel like this phrase gets thrown around a lot when people really enjoy a book, but I can honestly say that Illuminae really isn't like any book I've ever read before.",3,3,3
"I really enjoyed reading this book. Each time I picked it up to read I found myself giddy to slip back into this world of brutality and political intrigue. The pacing of this book is a slow burn--it is a lot of world building and character building but it was so fun to follow the characters and learn more about this period in history, which I know virtually nothing about. The ending left me dying to read more, and I can't wait for the other two books to eventually come out!",3,3,3
3.5 Stars. I did enjoy this one slightly more than the first one. I thought it introduced a lot of great new characters and did a much better just showing instead of telling (which was my biggest problem with the first one). While I really enjoyed the first 100 pages after that I thought the plot slowed down a lot and I started to really lose interest. That's what really brought down the rating for me. I will say though that this is still one of the most original YA series I have ever read.,3,3,3
"I had a lot of fun reading this one! It was really compelling and I liked all of the characters a lot. It was equal parts creepy, funny, and romantic. The only problem I had with the book that knocked it a star was the fact that there would be times when reading where I felt that certain events were really choppy and didn't flow in a way that made sense, or Mara reacted to something in a way that I didn't understand or wasn't believable. I'm really hoping a lot of things get answered by the end of the trilogy. Other than that I really enjoyed this and can't wait to start the next one after that ending!",3,3,3
"I felt like there were a lot of missed oppertunities in this book. Overall, I just didn't like the direction she chose for the ending of this series. I was nervous when I picked it up and saw how short it was, but I thought that maybe because it was so short it would be action packed, but I felt like NOTHING happened in this book. It was hard for me to stay invested in this series, and I feel like I may have enjoyed the series more as a whole if I marathoned it instead of waiting for each book and reading them as soon as they released. I just felt like this was a really anti-climactic way to end a series about an anti-hero that had so much potential. This is definitely one series where I just disagree with the hype.",3,3,3
"Reading this book, at first, seemed very tedious to me. I wanted a decision from the main character so badly, and was so angry that she couldn't seem to make up her mind about anything and when she did make up her mind she changed it a day later. But really I think that I just really sympathize for the situation she is in. I don't focus on as many of the smaller details as she does, but I'm not sure what I want for her in the long run. I personally prefer Aspen over Maxon and think it would be great if she just waited out his military service and lived a nice quiet life as a two since she hates being in the spotlight. However, I want her to become queen not because I want her to necessarily be with Maxon, but because I want her to be able to use her power as Queen to fix their broken society because she has the courage and passion to do it!",3,3,3
"I was pleasantly surprised with this book! It didn't pan out at all the way I thought it would, and is pretty different from a lot of books I've read recently. It doesn't really focus on romance at all, even though the female and male protag work together for a lot of the story, which I thought was refreshing. The book focuses a lot more on friendships and had more action and mystery than I was anticipating for a realistic fiction book. A super fun and easy read.",3,3,3
"Whoa. Its different from the way I remember the movie. The movie works as a movie, but the book sure works well as a book. The movie builds to a dramatic ending, but the book keeps you on the edge throughout, and has charming moments to boot. I can't get enough of the lawyer as hero! Well worth the read.",3,3,3
"It took about half way into this book for the humor to start hitting my funny bone. Making fun of the deaf, the overweight and the handicapped is a bit hard to get into, but the author tries to make this easier by having them be nasty people---think of the old Seinfeld episodes of the ""Bubble Boy"" etc. The first half is rather dark and cynical. But then about halfway through, the parody of the work place really started to turn from awful to wonderful, and the narrator gets into a hilarious exchange with the ""dealer"" in his building and then his overbearing girlfriend loses it during their breakup, so the second half I quite enjoyed.",3,3,3
"This was written in a seventies pot-boiler style, which is not really my cup of tea. The idea was amusing, but the realization seemed a bit stretched. There were a few laughs, but mostly I remember a wish to get through it. It did keep me from boredom in a hotel room, but when I got back home I had better things to read and it languishes on my unfinished shelf.",3,3,3
"I read this once in high school, and re-read it to my boys this year. It is wonderful--the pacing is good, the adventure unique and the main characters admirable (and loveable). We have now moved on to Fellowship of the Ring.",3,3,3
My first book by Hurston since she showed up in a deck of famous author cards. Very original and easy to read once you can get into the flow of converting the spelling of vernacular speech into spellings you are familiar with. Hilarious sayings and stories. The protagonist is strong like that in the Color Purple (Alice Walker loves this book) and her three (consecutive) husbands are also well drawn and believable. Wonderful.,3,3,3
"Eudora Welty hits one out of the park with her pitch perfect white trash versus the educated/cultured. This short, well-sketched novel builds slowly to the last angry scene in which words are finally exchanged. Perfectly describes the lament of humble, reflective persons when confronted with persons who care only about themselves.",3,3,3
"Rowling really hits it out of the park with the characters and story in this volume. It is not bogged down by scenes involving Voldemort. No, the story's drama is driven by a human character (Professor Umbridge) who is easily recognized and hated as she continually ups the ante in a quiet battle of wills against Gryffindor and the good professors of Hogwarts. After the initial action and excitement, the story drags a bit with Sirius Black's family history, but after the students arrive in Hogwarts, the story never lets up its pace. First rate! Oh--and my boys loved it as well!",3,3,3
"I have not done a lot of dabbling in the Sci-Fi space, and here I am jumping right into Sci-Fi from a different culture and political system from the get go. This tale is a lot of fun, with alien history, random murders, physics, global regime changes, nano-technology and the Chinese Cultural Revolution to boot! The evil environmentalists are interfering in pure science which is humanity's only chance to.... SPOILER ALERT. Some pretty well drawn characters and some serious writing and the science is all good.",3,3,3
"Science is hard, but reading this book is easy. Elizabeth Kolbert pens another thoughtful volume, this time explaining how the death of other species is a warning for our own. Ask not for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for us, too. Can we think our way out of this pickle? One can only hope, because dramatically changing our lifestyle seems to be completely off the table. Hell, we can barely get the oldies to switch to energy saving lightbulbs and low flow toilets without screaming about communistic fascism.",3,3,3
"I remember the moment in 1988 when my beloved aunt mentioned the book to me, saying it had a lot to think about. Now, thousands of miles and decades away, reading this feels like an anthropological dig, but the book is worth the read because of the excellent writing and the plausible plot. The way the government is overthrownaken is disturbingly realistic, a sort of Jade Helms led by Jesse Helms and Pat Robertson, the handmaid ends up living with Jimmy Swaggart and Tammy Faye Bakker, and the executions are tribal rituals. Hallelujah.",3,3,3
"Outstanding Roy has a facility for language that at times reminded me of James Joyce--alliterative and original. The scenes are colorful, poetic and fascinating. The points of view and the eye of the narrator is that of an artistic film director, watching the details of the objects and sounds in scene yet not losing sight of the principle action.",3,3,3
"Excellent political and emotional tale by Highsmith. The road trip turns this novel into a brilliant entry into 50s noir rivaling Lolita. Full confession: I wanted Carol to shoot the bastard! Creepy Richard stands in for much of society, with Harge the judge and jury, and that mousey little housemaid doing the Man's bidding. Fight the power!",3,3,3
"This is a novel about transformation, a weekend version of The Road's apocalypse. Lasting impressions: The dark menace of the metal working shop, the golden glint in the eye of the underwear model, the alpha male and his less enthusiastic sidekicks, the do what you must heroics, which is the transformation/deliverance, and the sheer excitement of the 'most dangerous game.' My reading notes came out sparse, because the poetry is baked into every line and does not sift to notes well. My cousin and I have a disagreement about ranking -- I have always fought grade inflation, but rankings above three seem to be more about emotional punch, which is a function of individuality. Mark--I did like this book.",3,3,3
"This book has almost made me believe in time travel. How in the f* could he have written this in 1955?! It predicts everything that the US did in in Vietnam to completely screw the pooch, but which did not happen until the first half of the 1960s. Graham Greene was either a genius or he had some wicked good connections to something or someone. And then of course, the fact that this was written then and then everything happened anyway, makes me (and should make you) really, really sad. So that is why it's a five.",3,3,3
"This was a book I wanted to love but I just didn't. It felt clunky and off. Everything that happened before she got on the bus was backstory and not really necessary. We could have learned about it as she told Andrew about it and it would have speed things up considerably. It just didn't do it for me. It was okay, but nothing amazing.",3,3,3
"I loved this book so much. Puck's wit definitely was a high point, but I also liked the budding relationships. I adored this book so much more than I can really even verbalize. The fey world and the human world are so vivid and I love how much it is grounded in reality by the descriptions of normal, every day things. It really helps you to imagine that a world like this really could be hidden right inside our own.",3,3,3
"Really enjoyed this one. It is not as good as the Eona Duology but this first book is obviously meant to set the foundation for the coming 2 books and as such, was slow at times but I didn't even find the slow bits to be tedious or anything of the sort and the story really picks up a fast pace in the last 200 pages or so. I genuinely can't wait to see where Goodman takes this story, it has such great potential. And as usual, the attention to historical detail is astounding. Goodman draws from real historical characters and events and I really admire a well-researched story.",3,3,3
"Rating: 3.5 This book had a lot of issues. The romance made no sense at all to me, most of the flashbacks were tedious and unnecessary, and the plot twist at the end was so predictable. Also, the fact that Yael, the seasoned fighter, trusted Luka and Felix so completely was unrealistic. Despite all of that, I really did enjoy the book and I thought it was a lot of fun. The first book to me was a lot better but the sequel is good too.",3,3,3
5 stars for giving me a better framework for how to organize my stuff and what stuff to keep than I'd ever had before. For instance it was so freeing to realize I don't have to keep gifts.,2,2,2
"A great finish to the D'Artagnan series - definitely enjoyed it. Ending wasn't what I wanted though, you could tell he was just trying to permanently end the series. It could easily be having seen the movie made me want more drama.",2,2,2
"Seven amazing stories. Each one you think can't possibly top the last, and then it does. We never really get to understand what is up with the Time Tombs - guess I have to keep reading. But the strength of each of these stories is worth it. One of the best books I've read in a while.",2,2,2
"Great book. A sci-fi classic. The fact that Gibson wrote this in 1984 is very impressive, as he makes many predictions that seem like they are coming true (was that a prediction?",2,2,2
One of my all-time favorites. The ultimate revenge story. One fascinating aspect to think about was that back in the day this novel appeared as a series of articles in the newspaper in France...,2,2,2
I read this while backpacking through Europe after college. It was a fascinating insight into the Spanish culture - anyone going there should definitely read this.,2,2,2
One of my top 5 favorites. Read this at the deeper/figuring your life out moments - it will give you strength and inspiration.,2,2,2
"After the first read, this book is the worst one in the Harry Potter series. Characters are not as likeable as they are in the other books. However, I recently reread it (after reading book 6), and found it to be a very good read.",2,2,2
"This might be the most deliciously dirty Alexa Riley story ever. I mean, look at the plot, ""stepdad"" and ""stepbrother"" want to f*k the teenager living with them in their trailer. But it's all very sweet and in good fun even though it is nasty and totally forbidden! If you have about 1/2 hour to spare, prepare yourself for a fun, filthy, sexy, erotic story. Loved it!",2,2,2
Contains major spoilers so only read this after you have completed the Indebted Series!! The Epilogue is filled with TONS of goodies and yummy scenes. Very creative ending to one of my favorites series. Enjoy!,2,2,2
"3.5 Stars First book by this author, not what I expected! Lots of swoony romance plus lots of drama. Loved the strong heroine, she saved the day for me! Also loved the very hot sexy times. Full review to come shortly.",2,2,2
"4.5 heart-pounding stars!! Malcolm Kyle Preston Logan Saint is quite the sexy alpha!! I need more, asap. I know there is much more to Saint than meets the eye. This is one of Katy's best books. Full review to come closer to release day!",2,2,2
"Get ready to be enthralled by the next part of Nila and Jet's story! There are scenes of intense passion, heartbreaking deceit, frightening and truly evil characters, and heart-stopping action. There's almost a historical vibe to this book, but it is most definitely a contemporary, sexy and very erotic story. I am literally on pins and needles waiting for the next installment. I need more Jethro!",2,2,2
"This novella gets 5 stars for the absolutely smoking hot sex scenes and great dialogue, and 1 star for the often laughable supporting storyline. There are so many completely made-up details in this story that would never, ever happen in real life (and would land the main characters in a real courtroom) that it made it very difficult for me to enjoy the sexy and engaging banter between the two main characters. I did love the alternating POV's but the glaring inaccuracies in this story aggravated the hell out of me. This is pure, escapist fantasy, that can be read in just one sitting. The author does a great job at establishing an emotional connection between the characters and I definitely will read the next installment.",2,2,2
"Fantastic, page-turning, gripping and unbelievably hot book. I am in love with both characters! Thank you, M. Pierce, for Matt and Hannah! By far, one of the most creative stories I have read in a long while. Drop everything and read Night Owl! Read our full review here",2,2,2
"WOW what a surprising book! Fabulous story and characters and we could NOT put this one down. These are not your usual cast of characters, they make terrible mistakes and some are filled with anger and dishonesty! We love love love Caleb. You will immediately feel the need to read Dirty Red. Trust us, things are not what they seem... We can only hope and pray for a HEA for our Caleb and Olivia.",2,2,2
Beautiful and painful. And funny. A must-read. You won't be sorry.,2,2,2
Kristen Ashley on steroids. Good story but lots of typos and errors.,2,2,2
One of Kristen Ashley's best books ever. You will love Faye and Chace. Another phenomenal story and yet another fabulous alpha male! Have Kleenex ready near the end. Thanks Kristen!,2,2,2
This is not for everyone but it is one of the most haunting books I have ever read. I wish I could give more than 5 stars!,2,2,2
"LOVED THIS BOOK. LOVED the characters, and that the heroine is older. The ending is a little drawn out though. Still great book.",2,2,2
"Ok so I'll say it... At first I was a little unsure how I felt about the book, since Gemma kept going back and forth on her decision making.. It was kind of getting annoying. But.... That twist blew me away,( still not sure how I feel about it though) . So yes it's a must read simply because that twist was so not expected!",2,2,2
"Ok I think this book should come with major warning labels! I mean come on can anyone withstand sooo much death and sorrow like Caden? I mean seriously poor guy!! I am left depressed and will require several hours of watching F.R.I.E.N.D.S episodes to get over the gut wrenching, depression leading, emotional wreck I became after reading this book.... Sooo if you want to cry, get depressed, then this book is for you. But as for me, as much s I loved Ever and Caden and only wish for their happy ending I don't think I can handle what I know will be a very sad journey on the next two books.",2,2,2
"The plot pacing was excellent, and the book held my attention. The well-rounded character development allowed me to change my opinion of several actors.",2,2,2
The plot a page turner. The maids reflect the Mammy stereotype. I would like to see the story written by one of the maids. I recommend Maid in the USA by Mary Romano as a corrective. It is an ethnography about real live maids along with research about labor law and how it hasn't been applied to housemaids. The dialect was a sad imitation of Black Vernacular English.,2,2,2
A page turner. Since I hate reality TV I valued the parody of it. Some good character development.,2,2,2
"I was afraid it would merely be a rerun of Pillars in a new era, but it managed to add a new dimension.",2,2,2
"Although it is long, it was hard to find a place to put it down. Some very interesting characters, especially the women.",2,2,2
"The book has been around a while so I was familiar with the general themes. Still, it was interesting to read about studies and see their methods analyzed as well as getting other details to fill in the outline.",2,2,2
Mildly entertaining. Some interesting social attitudes and family conflicts. Conversation was not convincing as conversation. Unexpected ending.,2,2,2
Surreal. Entertaining. Far more allusions than I can recognize. Worth pondering.,2,2,2
Deeply troubling. Deeply moving. Moves inexorably to its end.,2,2,2
"It was cute, fun to read. This book just proves that you just can't wait and stand by. You have to climb the stairs (lol) and make the first move. If not, nothing is ever going to happen.",2,2,2
"Second read, I dropped one star. I remember how boring and slow the book was, but it really picks up at the ending; if you can wait that long. 3.5 stars",2,2,2
I remember trying 3 times to read this but I always gave up on page 3 or so. So I skipped to book 2 and then read the whole series then came back to this book. It's hard to review this book without taking in the series a as a whole.,2,2,2
The lore in this series is incredible. I absolutely adore it. I felt like this book started dragging in the middle and it was completely unnecessary for the book to be 600 pages. There are still some loose ends but I enjoyed reading this so.,2,2,2
"I enjoyed this book. It wasn't perfect or innovating, and it was kind of predictable. Still, it was a nice read and I enjoyed the story. I also like how the romance was kind of already established, so it wasn't insanely cheesy or cliche or something.",2,2,2
"3.5 stars. Took me forever to read this because of college. I don't know if that affected me or not but once I started reading again after a month things seemed kind of dragged. It picked up again for a bit. Some of the decisions that Jacob and Emma made were so annoying and I felt like the ending ""battle"" was a bit of a cheap exit.",2,2,2
"A bunch of science and math jargon that I didn't comprehend but I enjoyed this book. It was slow at first then picked up. The humor is sarcastic and dry, so it's great and funny. My favorite parts were all then povs other than Mark's (what can I say? His are the most boring).",2,2,2
"Surprisingly, a lot of the dialogue from the movie were direct quotes from the book. Truly one of the most true adaptations of a book I've seen in a movie. It was enjoyable, but I feel like watching the movie first made me enjoy the book less, since I already knew what was going to happen.",2,2,2
"DNF. I got about half way before I lost interest in this book. I really enjoyed the writing, and the beginning was most enjoyable imo. This had some pretty outrageous moments but I believe that's part of its charm. Maybe one day I'll pick it back up and finish it but I am way too behind in my reading challenge to try and force myself to finish a book I'm not interested in anymore.",2,2,2
"The synopsis and the cover make this seem like a plain, old, cliche, YA retelling of Beauty and the Beast. Not true and very misleading. It was so much more. There were moments were I was like ""WHAT?!""",2,2,2
"Based off just the title and without reading the synopsis, this book wasn't what I was expecting. I still enjoyed it however, and it was a pretty quick read. Very enlightening in terms or dealing with autism and family dynamics.",2,2,2
"*I originially rated this 2 stars, but thinking back on this book I can't remember anything about it except that it was pretty boring, so rating has been dropped to 1 stars* *Original Review* It was okay I guess. Hayley was pretty irritating and boy, was she BITTER. Finn was alright, he was one of those eccentric young adult male love interests (*cough* Augustus *cough*). I don't really know whether or not I actually ""liked"" this book or not...",2,2,2
"1.5 stars? If I were to describe this book in one word I'd say ""disappointed."" I feel like I should give this book 1 stars because I didn't really enjoy it, on the other hand, it's not ""bad,"" per say. The plot twist that everyone is raving about didn't even surprise me. I had already deduced something similar several chapters back. Oh well.",2,2,2
"I can't believe this is suppose to be a children's book...it was creepy as hell and I honestly don't know how I feel about it. The book was weird and the ending sucked, but it wasn't bad and it was interesting. Honestly, the book feels incomplete but apparently there's a sequel that the author wrote like 10 years later so. Basically this is a dystopian novel that's hella weird yet it sucks you in but then feels incomplete and unfinished at the end.",2,2,2
"2.5 stars. The beginning was pretty confusing, and it took me a while to get used to the italic writing. I wish the author just decided on one point of view, instead, this book is written in both first person and in third person. Honestly the synopsis just explains the whole book. The book wasn't really what I was expecting, Arthur didn't even die until the middle of the book and those ""seven years of hardship"" were literally just skimmed over. I just skimmed the ending because I didn't feel like reading pages worth of italics.",2,2,2
3.5 stars. What I liked about this book particularly was the psychology and Kaysen's scenes with her fellow patients.,2,2,2
"Interesting and well-written nonetheless, even if you disagree with Ayn Rand's philosophy.",2,2,2
"For once, the relationship between a student and teacher isn't just black and white. Let me tell you, it's a VERY, very prominent gray.",2,2,2
"I get that this book contains fantasy elements but there were just some parts that felt plain unrealistic, to the point of absurdity. The writing wasn't too bad, minus some parts but whatever. The pacing was bad and the plot was thin. There were so many unanswered questions. I almost gave up on the book near the middle.",2,2,2
"This book started off great. Then, it went down the drain and I just wanted someone to stake all the characters because they were so DAMN annoying. This review sums it up best: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...",2,2,2
"Really liked this book and while I see the similarities to Vampire Academy I feel like VA had more charm. Still, this book was kind of predictable but I really liked it.",2,2,2
"Um. Can I have the second book now? Pretty please? Seriously, this was the first book in MONTHS that I have read in less than a day. It was just that compelling and interesting. Can't wait for the next book!",2,2,2
"Classical musician and ""bad-boy"" guitar player? Does this sort of remind anyone else of If I Stay? *update* Just finished the book, and okay, seriously? Cello?! Now it REALLY reminds me of If I Stay, oh, and the coma part too!? Anyways this book was cute but was filled with cliches",2,2,2
"Welp, we can all agree Nikki is a bitch.",2,2,2
"I truly enjoyed this book. Tina Fey is funny, but that's nothing new.",2,2,2
I'm pretty sure anyone who has/will ever read this book will want to take it and slap some sense into Lena with it. Multiple times. The book was kind of slow-paced for me but Ridley/Link(totes adorbs) and some Liv moments almost made up for it.,2,2,2
"This book is crazy. Also, the main character annoyed me, throughout the series yes, but even more so in this book. Like, really? She made THE SAME MISTAKE THREE TIMES. It was annoying.",2,2,2
"4.5 since it dragged on a bit in the middle. Not my favorite book in the series, but still, Rick Riordan managed to take me, yet again, on another wonderful, magical journey. Yes, pun intended.",2,2,2
"2.5 stars. This book was okay. The series overall was really disappointing...And Jesus Tobias and Tris were so annoying with their stupid angsty romance. Christ, they had sex like 5 times in this book...",2,2,2
"3.5 stars. (I'm actually still unsure whether to rate this 3 or 4 stars but I'll just go with 4 for now, but honestly it really is 3.5) This book kind of dragged in the middle-end but other than that I was pretty invested. I mean, who isn't interested in romantic drama? Also, while I was reading this all I could think about is the fact that boys were just as much fuckboy-y in the early 19th century as they are today.",2,2,2
"4.5 stars *sigh of content* Faith in Jennifer Brown restored. I LOVE Hate List but was EXTREMELY disappointed by Bitter End. Well, after reading this book, safe to say she has redeemed herself(at least in my eyes). This book was pretty predictable and the ending was open-ended but it was beautifully written and the journey was amazing! Learned a lot about OCD too!",2,2,2
"The book that got me into PJ. This was my first Percy Jackson book that I read. I remember being at the library and wanting to find a book to read and seeing this book and remembering reading about how Percy Jackson was being made into a movie or something and deciding to read this book because of that. One of the best decisions I have ever made in my life. It introduced me to my favorite book series. Literally the next day, I was at a bookstore and I had my dad spend $100 on the box set without even knowing what the books were about (other than they were Percy Jackson) and having no idea whatsoever if I would even like it.",2,2,2
"2nd readthrough: 3.5 stars. Every time I reread an Ellen Hopkins novel I notice something new about the formatting that I didn't notice before (or maybe I did notice but just didn't mention it?). For example, during my second read through of this book, about 3/4 of the way through, I realized (or re-realized?) that each of the 5 narrators have different formatting for their POV! How cool is that! It always amazes me how Ellen Hopkins can write books like these; it must take an insane amount of attention to detail.",2,2,2
"The first time I read this I rated it 4 stars because before I read it my friends told me that people thought it wasn't as good as the previous books. Stupidly, I let others' opinions influence me before I even read it. I reread it a second time and it is  fucking brilliant .",2,2,2
Couldn't finish it. I was 5/6 of the way done with the book and I just had to put it down because it was so boring. Nothing exciting happened and I felt like the book was dragging.,2,2,2
"Let me just say that before I read this book I liked to think of myself and neutral and leaning toward Team Unicorn...Now, post-reading of this book, it is safe to say that I am Team Zombie. The zombie stories were brilliant and excellent, the unicorn stories (with the exception of 2-3 stories) were just plain horrible and stupid.",2,2,2
"I feel like I would have appreciated this book even more if I read ""A Wrinkle in Time"" beforehand. Anyways, I wasn't really feeling the  time travel stuff   but everything else, the friendship/family dynamics were A+.",2,2,2
"...disappointed at all the hype this book had but I guess it just wasn't the book for me. If I had to describe it in one word, PRETENTIOUS. Also, it didn't help that halfway through the book I was extremely bored and I had to FORCE myself to finish it...maybe I'm missing something?",2,2,2
"a beautiful book, beautiful illustrations and a really nice story",2,2,2
I can't even begin to express how beautifully written this book is. I'd recommend it to everyone. (currently rereading it),2,2,2
"Although this book was not heart-touching or something, it was nice, just a fine read. I thought the end was a bit strange, when Madison claims to have stolen the diamonds. I mean, first she did not want her father in her life, then she loves him, and then he steals all those things, he lied to her, and she takes credit for it. That is not the Madison who wants all the fame .",2,2,2
"This one is going back to my 'to-read' shelve, I will continue reading it when I have more time for it.",2,2,2
Really enjoyed this book! J.R.R. Tolkien is a really good story teller: his writing style is funny and doesn't bore you. I look forward to seeing the movie - it has a great cast and I already heard a lot of good things about it!,2,2,2
"Excellent plot, shit writing. Geore R. R. Martin's metaphors are factually painful and he's so damned pleased with every outfit he's ever created he just can't WAIT to tell you all about it (in detail, frequently, and at inappropriate moments). Also, strangely obsessed with the breasts of a thirteen year old girl.",2,2,2
"The only reason this is 2 stars instead of 1 star is part 4, which is really what the entire book was leading up to. That was the only reason I wanted to keep reading, everything else was pointless exposition.",2,2,2
I absolutely loved this! These are the socially conscious fairy tales we all need and deserve. Such a good collection and a perfect way to end my Miss Peregrine binge read.,2,2,2
"One of the most beautiful, heartbreaking, thought-provoking books I have ever read hands down. Not much more I can say other than Syvia Plath is so important and she should be celebrated and honored for her voice and the mark she left on literature.",2,2,2
Completely loved the start to this series. It captivated me in a way that reminded me of when I first started the City of Bones series. I loved the characters and this magical world is like nothing I've ever read before. I can't wait to see where this story goes from here.,2,2,2
"I didn't feel like this book was as strong as the first one, but there were still moments that blew me away. I'm not feeling attached to any characters yet but I think that might change soon.",2,2,2
My favorite installment so far! I'm so bad at writing reviews for later books in series but this book was amazing. It had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish and I've grown so attached to all of these characters. I'm so excited to read winter but at the same time I'm so not ready.,2,2,2
Loved this book. I'm just enjoying this whole world and these stories so much. There were so many brilliant and creative bits in this book that just really really made me appreciate Meyer as an author and a genius. I'm so excited to start Cress soon (and for more Thorne).,2,2,2
"4.5 stars, just because I struggled so much with the beginning of this book and it took me a long time to get into it. Once I did get into it, however, I read the last 280 pages in one sitting!",2,2,2
This was a fantastic (yet heartbreaking) conclusion to my favorite duology. Leigh Bardugo proves that you don't need very many books to write a captivating and well-structured series. The ending was bittersweet but still completely satisfying.,2,2,2
J.K. Rowling will always amaze me and is my ultimate hero when it comes to writing. The fact that she can write from so many different personas and create so many unique creatures from nothing is extraordinary to me. I had so much fun reading this book.,2,2,2
"I love Richelle Mead, but this book wasn't as good to me as her Vampire Academy and Bloodlines books. It might just be me-- I don't know if I've ever read a stand-alone dystopian book that I really got into. I prefer the character growth over the span of a series. But I liked the concept of the book and the characters, I just think you can always do so much more with the story if you have more books to work with.",2,2,2
"Really excellent, I think this has been my favorite Shadowhunter Academy installment so far. It was very cute and brought in a lot of characters from The Mortal Instruments, which I always love to see. I think if you ship Malec you'll love this one",2,2,2
"Ally Carter's newest series has everything typical of an Ally Carter book in the best way possible. Carter's books are always fun and full of strong female characters. I think that this series is a little more mature than some of her other series, but it could just be that she has grown as a writer. Overall a great plot and fun characters.",2,2,2
"I read Delirium so many years ago and I can't believe that I didn't want to continue with the series at the time. I'm so glad that I decided to continue on with the series now! I appreciate Oliver's writing now more so than I did before, and I think that the whole concept of this series is absolutely beautiful. This was a great second book. I don't even mind the fact that there is a love triangle because it only seems fitting for a book about love and how it can hurt you, but is ultimately worth the pain. This is one of the best dystopian series around and I would highly recommend it!",2,2,2
"I want to say this book is the final book in the series but I'm not 100% sure. I'm just going to assume it is because everything was wrapped up pretty nicely. Not bad as far as endings go. I often find myself highly unsatisfied by the endings to trilogies in YA books and this one wasn't too bad. And I liked the series as a whole. Now it's time to Netflix the TV series, although I think it's going to be really different from the books!",2,2,2
"I didn't know how much I needed this reread until I started reading this book again. Fangirl is just one of those books that understands you, and I'm so happy that I could read this book as a junior in high school and a junior in college and love it for the same and for different reasons.",2,2,2
"original rating: 5 stars new rating: 3 stars I had a lot more problems with the story and characters this time. It definitly would not be a favorite read if I read it now, but I did love it a lot when I initially read it.",2,2,2
"A cross between Cormac McCarthy The Road and many a Stephen King novel, but not as interesting as either. The ennui wafts off the page like the smell of old cheese. You want to run from the bookstore where you are paging through this black hole of a novel and bolster your sense of purpose with a good hot cup of joe and the laughter of children.",2,2,2
"Great conclusion to a great series! Rowling outdoes the Tolkien in the long forest fugitive scenes, and really packs a punch with the romance!",2,2,2
"It only gets better as the suspense builds in this terrific, mysterious tale of possible double-crossing and virtuousness that delivers the best emotional mix of good versus evil on both a meta- and micro- scale since the Allies versus the Axis in the Second World War.",2,2,2
"A delightful, highly readable stroll through the creation of the OED with some small asides to period London and surgeons in the Civil War. Good for leisurely summer reading.",2,2,2
"Muriel Spark is well out of the politically correct zone in this ""blame the victim"" novelette. In a he-said, she-said world, this is Exhibit Number One in the she-was-asking-for-it Defendant's bar.",2,2,2
"Lemony Snicket delivers once again with this riveting mystery of dastardly plots, idiot guardians and resourceful and heroic children. My boys love this series.",2,2,2
"My sons laughed uproariously several times at this brilliant tale which elegantly combines a saddening death with brilliant wit and comedy. Lemony Snicket has the ticket! ""Blasted Furnaces of Hell!""",2,2,2
"An excellent read for bedtime--much better than most--good new words and pithy explanations--and an interesting story to boot. My younger son is spellbound. and at the end of book 1 I asked him if I should get the next in the series .... ""yes!"" thanks Parenthetical!",2,2,2
"My three year old loved, LOVED, this book so much that afterwards we started role playing, with me as the Station Inspector and him as Hugo Cabret. Highly recommend.",2,2,2
"A well written pot boiler with some interesting social commentary. The homeless former employees of the blue book factory was bittersweet. Well drawn main characters, who we all love to love and hate, in equal measure.",2,2,2
"Starts out strong and powerful and going nowhere but then stretches into an interesting background on the main character's relationship with his father. Loved the car, the girlfriends, the excellent bit of writing on a tennis match. The main character has a wonderful line about life and trains, which I will not ruin for you.",2,2,2
"I teared up when was reading this to my two sons, ages five and three, and recalling the only other time I encountered this book when my mother read it to my sisters and I in the dark of our dining room three blocks from the campus in 1969. Why did I want to read it to my own children when I only heard it read once at age six (or perhaps seven)? I did not remember. I only recalled that there was something in it, some spark of light that needed to be passed on to my children.",2,2,2
"I stopped shortly after his parody of the Jewish professor, which left a bad taste. Perhaps I will try again some day.",2,2,2
"Apologies to all the fans, but I felt like this book was shouting at me. Perhaps it was the fact that I was having to deal with a neighbor who was a member of an organized crime syndicate opposing the construction of my house, and I just needed something more comforting at the time.",2,2,2
"Riveting! Even better than the movie or the Mad comics parody of the movie. It is a brilliant novelization of what surely must have a non-fiction, i.e., historical core. One can easily imagine wacky captains such as Captain Queeg, fading in and out of mono-mania, stern and petulant, crazed and bold.",2,2,2
"Lost me after the sweaty, limestone dust filled rape scene",2,2,2
Most devastating lead in to the end of an affair that I have ever read. Captures like no other the fatalistic core of youthful love. Beautiful description of Taisho era Japanese aristocratic life.,2,2,2
"Well written and brilliantly entertaining. The writing is light and the story moves forward, and she has a sharp wit. This is the best I have read (out of 3) of Austen.",2,2,2
"This novel has a holy shit moment that rends. That and the writing is quite beautiful, almost poetic. A horrible, wonderfully written story about slavery, nostalgically set on the banks of a river in my home state. Worth reading.",2,2,2
"A few choice words for a society rotting at its core. And Metexas has the gall to name his study group The Socrates Society-- check what Socrates means by an examined life, chucklehead.",2,2,2
For the description of the machine of capital alone in the early chapters this book is a stand out. And then later the scene in the farm store.,2,2,2
Wonderful period description of what it was like for British traveling to South America. One of the best descriptions of a fever I have ever read.,2,2,2
"""I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity.""",2,2,2
"Stendhal held that politics in a work of art is like shooting at gun in a theater. Well, I hate to disappoint you, Stenny, but my counterpoint is exhibit A, Citizen Kane, and b is Roth's Our Gang. Exhibit C is Black Swan Green, D is Apocalypse Now, E is The Quiet American, and F is One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I could go on, but I think the point is made.",2,2,2
"A mid-level banker is put through a hellish trial in some bureaucratic attic. But his bosses get off scot-free. Of course, there were never any clear charges, and there is never an arrest. And then there is some dream, was it, about the guard of the door to the wonderful room, and he was afraid to go in--thought he couldn't get past the guard ... I am sorry, I am not expressing myself well here. What I want to say is that there are layers upon layers of meaning here, and plenty of food for thought.",2,2,2
"The rape (its Oates, so no surprise) of a high school daughter breaks this family apart, but then they heal in odd, disfigured ways. Good description of the exteriors and interiors of a rural society like the one I grew up in.",2,2,2
Like reviewing a piece by Mozart. Who am I to judge? This prose is poetry in motion.,2,2,2
"The same scene told from different view points, steam of consciousness writing, all linking together. Like an LSD trip--really takes you away. Read it late at night sipping a little something.",2,2,2
"What a heroine! I could not put this down! Distilled amorallity wrapped up in beauty, a desire for material goods. No, I guess things can not make you happy, but maybe you don't even care.",2,2,2
"I had early given it two stars because of the style of writing. Should have given it a three, because I did like it, and it deserves more for sheer originality--something that is hard to keep in mind after so much time has passed. But this is an ur-text.",2,2,2
"This idiot is a true idiot, in the style of a sort of warmed over Jesus type, but incanting a sort of ""can't we all get along?"" refrain while pining over a girl of questionable morals (for the day) and plotting against a rival. Many funny moments, which keep it going.",2,2,2
"The populist plot summary/marketing plug for this book on the back cover was laughable. There is not much of a plot, but it has internal suffering galore. And a menacing interview with the detective on the case half way through which had all the power of the really old Colombo episodes--the ones done by Steven Spielberg. If you have a conscience, you should enjoy this.",2,2,2
"God is truly in the details with the life and love that shimmers off the pages of your work of art. Rest In Peace, David.",2,2,2
"Great introduction of this world I've been a JLA fan for several years, but somehow never got around to reading this series. After this prequel I'm ready to dive in. I really loved Jas as a character and found her very relatable.",2,2,2
Wow. This book left me feeling utterly wrecked and hopelessly blessed. Full review to come.,2,2,2
"I liked Obsidian, but Onyx was definitely better! At times I was really annoyed with the storyline, and how Katy was ignoring everyone for Blake, but otherwise, no complaints. The cliffhanger was big, so of course I'm looking forward to reading the next one.",2,2,2
"Listened to audiobook. Told from the husband's perspective, the book was uncomfortable to listen to, and would also, I think, be equally uncomfortable to read. Points given for creativity, though, because similar plot lines have been narrated from the wife's point of view.",2,2,2
"Listened to audiobook. Characters are flat and predictable. The writing is uneven and uninspired. While I'm certain this shouldn't bother me as much as it did, what teenager today is named 'Olive'? I felt that every plot point was dealt with superficially, and there were so, so many. Including fewer and explorIng them in more depth might have enhanced the novel.",2,2,2
Listened to audiobook. This story is told in reverse. The plot seemed insubstantial and characters were flat. Not a satisfying read for me.,2,2,2
"Listened to audiobook. The narrator's voice was not a good match, for me, for this type of book. Great plotting. Renee Ballard is a complex and intriguing character.",2,2,2
"An unoriginal story line, poorly written with a predictable outcome. Switching back and forth in time every few pages, at the beginning of the novel and again at the end, were also annoying to me. One more of the far-too-many-already crime novels based on violence against women.",2,2,2
"The problems with this book have been articulately expressed in many reviews. I decided the best way to reach my goal in a reading challenge was to listen to this on eAudiobook. This was a mistake on my part. Ariadne Meyers, narrator for Violet, does a creditable job; Kirby Heyborne, narrator for Finch, sounds far older than a 17 year old and as though this is not an audiobook, but a stage performance of incredible import.",2,2,2
"I was really looking forward to this because I needed a good scare and it's been a long since I'd read a good horror novel. Maybe it's just me, but I wasn't frightened in the least. The story was not bad at all but I didn't really get what I wanted from this book.",2,2,2

Darker than her other books.,1,1,1
I liked it well enough to want to read the other two.,1,1,1
The book is more of a challenge than I have time for right now. It has come due at the library and I cannot renew it. I'll try again later.,1,1,1
"It has been a long time since I've read a ""dear reader"" style narrative. I found it annoying. But I did want to know who would get the credit for creating the black tulip. That plus it being a group read kept me reading. At least I'd been forewarned not to look for realism.",1,1,1
That was seriously the shortest yet cutest book I have ever read.,1,1,1
And then all of a sudden im for team will. 4.5/5 bc. I wanted more fight scenes :O jem djjqjjujnfhe but will is so s weet omg,1,1,1
"It's a must read. If you're the type of person who wasn't compelled to finish the Mortal Instruments, this book will bring justice.",1,1,1
First Neil Gaiman read,1,1,1
"""He's hot."" Oh my gosh, hahahahaha. 2 stars cause ""it was ok' This book was a fast read and it wasn't really that interesting.",1,1,1
"I want the book now March 18, 2013: The cover is gorg!",1,1,1
charlie is such a cutie.,1,1,1
I FINISHED IT!!!!! THAT WAS A HAPPY ENDING,1,1,1
"April 17, 2014 : Wow that suspense update : April 12, 2014: After 2 years, I'm going to try this book again, now that the trilogy just ended a few days ago. I hope I'll like it more and maybe I'll also get into it. (Probably because I was 12 years old when I was trying to read this...too young.) this book wasn't my type of genre, i suppose ... i got bored, but it did seem interesting and i hope i'll try to read it again.",1,1,1
2 stars because --,1,1,1
Perfect perfect just perfect EVERYONE LOVES FINNICK AND JOHANNA!,1,1,1
"I'm going to read this to finish up my dypstopian book challenge for 2013 but before I even open the book I'm going to predict, right now, that Ky is the person Cassia ends up with.",1,1,1
3.5stars. Not as good as the first one until the middle end of the book but still good none the less. The ending is just as vague and infuriating though (although that could be me just being dramatic).,1,1,1
Markus Zusak made a post about how he enjoyed this book...must check it out now!,1,1,1
"Jeeze, this book was one heck of a ride. 4 stars because there were parts that just seemed to drag along.",1,1,1
"Stopped reading this at page 91. I don't know if it's just the mood I'm in or what, but I could not get into this at all. Disappointing.",1,1,1
Digging the cover. Might check this book out.,1,1,1
Did someone say steam punk? Count me in.,1,1,1
"Umm wow. I haven't enjoyed a short story this much since The Audition...Okay, this definitely attracted my attention.",1,1,1
2.5 stars. The movie would definitely give me nightmares.,1,1,1
"3.5 stars. Man, this book can be pretty depressing...",1,1,1
I loved it. But I think that's because I watched the movie a day before I read the book. Watching the movie beforehand helped me appreciate the novella. And Audrey Hepburn <3.,1,1,1
I love a good mythology book.,1,1,1
"Eh. Took me about a month to read this. Honestly, I was sort of uninterested. It MIGHT have been because I'd just finish playing the Last of Us. Quite frankly, I think that the story works better in video game form.",1,1,1
"Hmm...Tilt, then Triangle and now maybe Tangled?",1,1,1
"props to whoever designed these covers 'cause honestly, I'm in love...with the covers that is. Also maybe this series :). Usually I get sick of that cliche ""love triumphs over all"" kind of romance but I think I'm o.k. when it comes to this series.",1,1,1
"Love the show on Netflix, hopefully the book will be good too.",1,1,1
So much happened in this book.,1,1,1
"UGH. 2018 release date?? WHY. SO CHAOL CAN GET HIS OWN BOOK? I'm obviously the only one here, but I give zero fucks about Chaol. He's such an asshole.",1,1,1
Really strong debut book. It never got boring and I can't wait for McGinnis' next book.,1,1,1
"Cover reminds me of that stock photo that was used as ""Tali's Face"" from ME3",1,1,1
Read this years ago but I'm pretty sure I cried at the ending...,1,1,1
"4.5 stars. Man, can this guy write.",1,1,1
"I want to read this book, especially since I heard the second book is even better, but I just saw that Sarah J. Maas is turning this into a 6-book series instead of a trilogy and the last book is slated for release in 2020... I'm gonna wait a bit because I'm sure it'll be torture to wait.",1,1,1
"Man, oh man. I don't even know what to say about this book. So many things...",1,1,1
This is why kids don't like to read.,1,1,1
"First read this freshman year of high school, and just read it again for my writing class 2nd year of college.",1,1,1
One of the best books in the series I think.,1,1,1
"This one definitely wasn't as good as the second one. Not much happened, really.",1,1,1
"2020..DAFUQ? I'll have graduated college by then and probably have a career...Actually, my main concern is that he might die before he finishes the series...",1,1,1
"I guess I read this but I never rated it? Oh well, until I reread it I'll just give it 3 stars. Original release date is the 27th but I bought it today? What....?",1,1,1
Dat Cover Tho.,1,1,1
"Not worth anywhere near $2. I say it should've been free. Anyways, I adore Ridley and Link and I may ship them more than Ethan and Lena now...",1,1,1
Just bought this book. Bout to read it (in a couple months...) LEGGO!,1,1,1
Hate the cover...,1,1,1
Oh my gosh. Ugh my heart. Rick Riordan you did it again.,1,1,1
I feel as though I should re-read this...maybe soon?,1,1,1
This was much better than the first one.,1,1,1
I loved this book. There simply isn't any way I could write a review that would sum up my feelings.,1,1,1
"Expected a light, easy read and I got just that. And so much more...",1,1,1
"I guess I didn't track this on goodreads when I first read this so I'll just rate it 3 stars, but I have to reread it.",1,1,1
Probably one of the WORST books I have ever read...EVER.,1,1,1
"Kind of sad this is the last book in the VA universe but alas, all good things must come to an end. I really enjoyed this ride. Also, what is it with authors  always bringing back a villain that's supposed to have died or be done with? I mean, it happened in the TMI and a bunch of other works. Just curious.",1,1,1
There's just  something  that prevents the books in this series from getting 5 stars...,1,1,1
"Well, tried to re-read it and couldn't finish. Guess I'll have to try again later.",1,1,1
4.5 stars. Slow at times but still a great read.,1,1,1
"God this novella is depressing...I have to say, I totally saw this coming (although maybe not the gruesome parts)",1,1,1
"I like to call this book the ""mind fuck"" book...",1,1,1
I remember reading this in 5th grade...I shall re-read it one day,1,1,1
3.5 stars. The ending kind of reminded me of Lord of the Flies...,1,1,1
It's 3 in the morning and I'm happy/sad crying. I love this book.,1,1,1
"Aww fluffyness level= max. Oh, and the protagonist has some raging hormones...",1,1,1
Favorite book in the series.,1,1,1
Hey! No pointless love triangle? YES PLEASE! :D,1,1,1
"R.I.P. Ms. Harper Lee, Feb. Thank you for writing one of the great American novels.",1,1,1
"I didn't like it as much as the other Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus books, but still it was an easy and enjoyable read.",1,1,1
"2 or 3 stars the book couldn't really capture my attention although the story wasn't boring. (I only read The Turn of the Screw, not The Aspern Papers).",1,1,1
"Should have read it in English, but I couldn't find that version on my e-reader so I just read this version.",1,1,1
I have the Dutch and English book now :) really liked it,1,1,1
"I am rereading the HP serie, this time round I'm reading the English versions.",1,1,1
"Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to read (all) of this book yet. But if it's not even out yet and pissing off white supremacists, you know it's going to be amazing. Get your preorders in now.",1,1,1
Review will be on Boxers as soon as I'm finished.,1,1,1
"A reread, but always enjoyable.",1,1,1
Read for class,1,1,1
I just love Amy Poehler so much,1,1,1
This book was GORGEOUS,1,1,1
There are no words. There will never be sufficient words ever again.,1,1,1
This book is a masterpiece,1,1,1
This was the perfect ending to an amazing series. Not much else I can say but that.,1,1,1
"I think I might have enjoyed this book even more the second time around. I'm even more excited for The Rose and the Dagger to come out on Tuesday now, and I didn't think that was possible.",1,1,1
3.5 or 3.75,1,1,1
Re-read the illustrated edition and completely loved it. Can't wait for the prisoner of azkaban to come out illustrated next year so I can continue the christmas re-reading tradition,1,1,1
very well written ... more later,1,1,1
The lesson here is that you cannot know whether you like something unless you try it. Some senators are not as smart as they think they are.,1,1,1
My oldest child is five. In a few years he will be able to write as well as Dan Brown.,1,1,1
Think hard.,1,1,1
"It is beautiful. I got lost among the flora, but do hope to take this up again some day when the kids are quieter, and the pace of life is slower.",1,1,1
"The sentences, they are beautiful.",1,1,1
I NEED this book like yesterday! Can't wait for this.,1,1,1
