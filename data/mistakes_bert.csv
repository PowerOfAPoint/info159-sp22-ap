564,3,2,1,"I was gonna give this book 3 stars, but I decided on 2 because justifying attempted rape is never o.k. I felt like this book set out to be one of those deep, pretentious books that set out to give you life lessons. I will admit that it did a good job of not being pretentious. It was extremely emotionally manipulative, however."
93,2,2,0,"I liked it a lot, but it doesn't really stand alone; it's too much of a setup for what I assume are going to be Rose's later emotional discoveries. I'm very impressed by Rose, though, and would like to follow her further!"
185,3,4,1,"There is something about the language used or the voice of the characters that makes me think the setting of this book is more modern/contemporary than it should be. I found that somewhat distracting but still enjoyed the story and the race against time to solve the murders and find an ancient, mythical artifact. I think I'd read another in the series. Although, wouldn't it have been so much cooler if the heroine, who managed to rescue herself from a horrific and traumatic experience seven years prior, had rescued herself at the end of this adventure too ? That would have gotten this book at least one more star."
598,4,4,0,"This is the best book I've read in a really really long time. I could feel myself slipping into a reading slump and I'm so thankful I picked this book up when I did because it managed to engage me like no other book I've read in a seriously long time. The best thing about this book is that it's so completely unique and different than anything I've ever read. Usually, I'm always drawing connections in my mind between books while I'm reading but this book really created a world of its own. I had absolutely no idea where the plot was headed or how things would resolve and I didn't see any of the plot twists coming, which is really rare for me because I've found that lately I usually always can tell where books are headed and see the plot twists coming before the main character. Despite the very dark tone of this book, Sabaa Tahir's writing style is so elegant and the themes and characters in this book were so beautiful."
563,2,2,0,"This book is all about female empowerment while also tackling many subjects such as racism, stereotyping, and sexuality. Seriously, it covers EVERYTHING. Feminism ftw. I like how it doesn't take itself too seriously though."
181,3,3,0,Well.....I liked the story and the personality of the characters. I loved how Alice brought everyone together. I also loved the unconventional family that she brought together. My only beef and it is only me because this is just a personal preference is that when I read I like more masculine leads with m/m. Rue and Erik were not my normal leads choice but the story was still sweet and I will read the next one to find out what happens next. I did love the quirkiness of Erik and how he over came so many challenges to finally be free of his own demons so he could find love.
650,3,4,1,"I remember the moment in 1988 when my beloved aunt mentioned the book to me, saying it had a lot to think about. Now, thousands of miles and decades away, reading this feels like an anthropological dig, but the book is worth the read because of the excellent writing and the plausible plot. The way the government is overthrownaken is disturbingly realistic, a sort of Jade Helms led by Jesse Helms and Pat Robertson, the handmaid ends up living with Jimmy Swaggart and Tammy Faye Bakker, and the executions are tribal rituals. Hallelujah."
235,2,2,0,Short but a very nice introduction to the book series. I actually really quite enjoyed it a lot! I thought it was nice that the main character was gay and I like how the rest of the story is set up in this 'foundation'.
28,2,2,0,"I have read every Outlander novel multiple times, and this one I read the least. Not because it's not excellent, but because it rips my heart out EVERY SINGLE TIME! Oh, it could all bed the King, or make men cover with a single White Lady glare."
614,3,2,1,"** spoiler alert ** I equally loved book 2, and am definitely hooked. I did feel it took a little while for them to get to sea, but I guess we can't bring in a love interest if we aren't on the land! My favorite thing by far was the Lively, and the descriptions of how fast she is and how much care the crew took keeping her a crack ship. Pride in what you do can be a great motivator. I also loved how Jack made them work the guns against all the batteries for practice."
469,1,1,0,Flavia is my spirit animal!
339,2,2,0,"A great example of a New Adult romance romance novel- filled with real and emotional story lines, tough situations, wonderful relationship, and new experiences."
627,3,2,1,"Original and refreshing, not to mention amazing. I love Marion's style of writing and I think I'm going to be eagerly awaiting ANY new book he writes. Even more stoked for the movie now. Beware of the explicit language in this book though. (Although the only cuss word that is constantly used in this book is the ""F"" word, it's used quite often.) Also, not gonna lie, there may have been oh, two or three parts (or 5+) that literally made me LOL and glad that I wasn't reading this in public... 5/5 (I would give it more stars if I could)."
805,1,1,0,A friend of Elizabeth's I met at a party said its a great primer to understanding philosophy...
638,3,4,1,"I felt like there were a lot of missed oppertunities in this book. Overall, I just didn't like the direction she chose for the ending of this series. I was nervous when I picked it up and saw how short it was, but I thought that maybe because it was so short it would be action packed, but I felt like NOTHING happened in this book. It was hard for me to stay invested in this series, and I feel like I may have enjoyed the series more as a whole if I marathoned it instead of waiting for each book and reading them as soon as they released. I just felt like this was a really anti-climactic way to end a series about an anti-hero that had so much potential. This is definitely one series where I just disagree with the hype."
553,2,2,0,Writing is all over the place. My first Megan Hart book. No clear point of view.
551,1,1,0,4.5 STARS! What a beautiful and VERY different story!! Not at all what I expected! Full review to come soon.
1,3,2,1,"I read this book before watching the movie (thank goodness, the movie was awful), and I enjoyed it immensely. The science and suspense were woven together in an exotic place to form a book that I look forward to reading again someday. I read it a long time ago, and though I can't remember details from it, I do recall being completely absorbed in it and left with some creepy imagery. I'm curious to see if it will be the same the second time around."
354,1,1,0,It is too late in the night to write it a review. It will be coming soon
899,1,2,1,"April 17, 2014 : Wow that suspense update : April 12, 2014: After 2 years, I'm going to try this book again, now that the trilogy just ended a few days ago. I hope I'll like it more and maybe I'll also get into it. (Probably because I was 12 years old when I was trying to read this...too young.) this book wasn't my type of genre, i suppose ... i got bored, but it did seem interesting and i hope i'll try to read it again."
365,1,1,0,I don't get it. The characters I think I'm supposed to like I actually hate with fiery passion.
496,1,1,0,You must be ready to start book 2 as soon as you finish this one. The ending kills you.
423,1,1,0,4.5 review to come
516,4,3,1,"A charming, tea drinker's tale about the furtive and futile impulses of a collection of aging British upper-crusters and their household help; a collection of their scheming, their fears, their denials, and their consideration. Perhaps quite cutting edge in its day. Spoiler Alert: Everyone dies in the end."
859,1,1,0,"Can't put it down, re-read it three times"
567,2,2,0,"This book was everything. I actually think I liked it a little more than the first one. (Only a little, because the first one was amazing, but still.) I never thought I would like this series as much as I do now. How these books manage to pack in so much action and create such great characters in the format that they do is incredible to me."
583,1,1,0,"Don't read in public. You are going to cry. There is no point fighting this, they're good tears."
373,1,1,0,I'm pretty sure that this could have been added onto the last book more succinctly.
492,1,1,0,"Ah....smutty vamps...I LOVED this. I hadn't read fantasy in a long time, and I'm glad I decided to read this. I'm hooked. Moving on to book 2!"
57,3,3,0,"I liked the first novel in The Custard Protocol, but it seemed...more forced, I guess than this one. Perhaps, the characters are better able to stand on their own after the events of Prudence, which isn't a bad thing. In my mind, the characters grew more and were better able to step out of the shadows of their parent's shadows from The Parasol Protectorate series. I give this book Two Parasols Up! Very much enjoyed and I look forward to future installments."
436,1,1,0,I liked this book will have review up on blog and here in a few days. Just got back from holidays so catching up.
210,3,4,1,"Roberts hits all the right notes in her latest romantic suspense, in which Bodine Longbow- head of her family's lucrative ranch and resort- stumbles across the body of the local bartender. She and her new employee (and old crush) Callen Skinner begin to suspect that a killer is making himself at home in their small Montana town, and a mystery from her family's past might hold the key to revealing his identity. Readers will find all the characters engaging and well formed, and the emotional ties- whether familial, friendly, or romantic- are realistic and enviable. Even the setting is three dimensional and seems to entice fans to plan a visit- after the killer is caught and happily ever after is achieved, of course! Special thanks to St. Martin's Press for the providing this in exchange for an honest review."
574,2,2,0,"4.5 stars, scorching hot sex scenes and great characters but the grammar took away from my enjoyment of the story."
796,1,1,0,Recommended by David Risher
531,4,2,1,"Considering most of the reviews I've seen about this book so far have been so-so, I really enjoyed it! I will say that I'm not at all a fan of scary movies and I tend to get scared very easily, so this may not be as exciting to hard core horror fans, but if you're like me and you want to dip your feet into the genre, I think this was great. Most people also didn't like the fact that the murderer gets revealed fairly early on, but the book didn't focus on who was commiting the crimes, but why they were commiting them, and I actually really enjoyed that aspect."
132,4,4,0,"A good read but definitely my least favorite Mistborn novel. I have really come to care for these characters (in particular I love Steris with an unholy love) and their relationships to each other and there were definitely some cool concepts/plot twists but I also found the book way too action heavy and the third act ""twist"" involving a certain character's behavior/alliances didn't pack the emotional punch for me I think Sanderson wanted it to. There was so much interesting information about the politics of Elendel in the last volume, I really missed that this time around. I feel like the other Mistborn books all have a lot more going on then what is essentially a quest for magical artifact/heist narrative. I still look forward to how Sanderson is going to wrap up this installment of the Mistborn saga in the next book."
828,1,1,0,Review coming soon!
524,4,3,1,"I love an erotic suspense and dark romance as much as the next person but this book just didn't quite do it for me. I literally felt dropped right into the middle of a story that had already begun, which was very disorienting. While many readers are raving about this book, for me there was no connection between the main characters and many of their actions felt mechanical, and the story, formulaic. I still would love to read the other books by this author, because their story lines sound very intriguing. Giving credit here for a very strong, kick-ass heroine, and a surprising ending. (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
758,2,1,1,"My sons laughed uproariously several times at this brilliant tale which elegantly combines a saddening death with brilliant wit and comedy. Lemony Snicket has the ticket! ""Blasted Furnaces of Hell!"""
840,1,1,0,4 1/2 D/s stars! With a suspenseful plotline!

5,4,4,0,"Awesome as usually the case with this author. What I loved most about this book was how morally complex it was. As terrible as North Carolina's eugenics program was, I can see how even well intentioned people could have designed and implemented it. Chamberlain eschewed melodrama and avoided painting characters as two-dimensional heroes and villains. She did a great job creating distinctive narrative voices for Ivy and Jane as well. Pretty much impossible to put down once you start."
746,2,2,0,"Really excellent, I think this has been my favorite Shadowhunter Academy installment so far. It was very cute and brought in a lot of characters from The Mortal Instruments, which I always love to see. I think if you ship Malec you'll love this one"
623,3,2,1,"It has been a while since I read it so I have forgotten details, but I remember mostly liking it. I wondered if amnesia would alter a personality as much as shown, but the author did do research. And the fiance's getting to know the new woman is a sort of reminder that we do change and that we shouldn't assume details about another."
936,1,1,0,Oh my gosh. Ugh my heart. Rick Riordan you did it again.
675,2,1,1,Beautiful and painful. And funny. A must-read. You won't be sorry.
275,2,3,1,This book was awesome!! I loved how the author replicated the feeling of doing archival research by using multiple narrators as well as faux historical documents. Each character here was engaging and fully realized. I was completely engrossed in both the 19th and 21st century plot lines. It was hard to put this down. Highly recommended.
940,1,1,0,"Expected a light, easy read and I got just that. And so much more..."
361,1,1,0,This was the best book I have read in years and years. Will do a full review this weekend but 10/10 would recommend.
591,4,2,1,"This started off with a bang, absolutely hilarious! This series should probably be read in order and I will defintiely read the first book to see what all the fuss is about. Tapping Her is a super-quick, very dirty and very funny bit of romantic comedy, with some laugh-out-loud moments and a great male POV. There is nothing emotional or angsty about this book and it's just a little something to pick up in between heavier reads. Not too much of a plot here, so don't expect War and Peace."
352,1,1,0,A great finish to a great series! Definitely a series to have a hard copy of and read over and over again.
526,4,3,1,"3.5 Stars Kate McCarthy is a favorite author of mine but surprisingly this book just did not do it for me. Although the book features a very strong heroine and and a talented but tortured hero, which I loved, the plot of this book fell flat for me and the so-called scandal was absolutely not scandalous in my eyes at all. Lots of readers fell in love with this book so definitely give this one a try and judge for yourself. I adore Kate McCarthy (Redemption is one of my top favorites) and look forward to her next book!"

237,2,1,1,Feel mean giving this one a 2 as it did make me smile in places (despite wanting to smash my kindle in places) so have rounded it up to 3. It also made my commute whizz by today.
895,1,1,0,"""He's hot."" Oh my gosh, hahahahaha. 2 stars cause ""it was ok' This book was a fast read and it wasn't really that interesting."
552,2,2,0,"I am officially obsessed with Alexa Riley's books!! The Mechanic was a delicious, smutty, sizzling hot story with some of THE dirtiest talkers around. These books are like palate-cleansers in between the main course. Highly recommended!"
204,3,3,0,"Restaurant owner Violet and single father/barbecue phenom Hogan find their personal and professional lives entwined as they discover that the perfect mate is definitely worth waiting for. Foster is my go to author for sweet sexy romance with just a smidge of suspense- she never lets me down. The main romance, secondary romance, & even a third young love story thread are all balanced perfectly. Fans- especially ones who enjoyed Don't Tempt Me should put this novel on their must read list. Thank you to Harlequin and Netgalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
789,2,3,1,"Listened to audiobook. Characters are flat and predictable. The writing is uneven and uninspired. While I'm certain this shouldn't bother me as much as it did, what teenager today is named 'Olive'? I felt that every plot point was dealt with superficially, and there were so, so many. Including fewer and explorIng them in more depth might have enhanced the novel."
12,4,3,1,"4.5 stars! Block out some time and get comfortable, because Behind Her Eyes is the kind of thriller that you'll want to read in one sitting- and then maybe read again as you come to terms with the shocking twists and clever stylings of Pinborough's creation. Even veteran suspense fans will be surprised while they shadow slightly depressed single mother Louise as she finds herself drawn into the unsettling marriage dynamics between handsome David and secretive Adele. #WTFthatending indeed! Thank you to Macmillan and St. Martin's Press for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
232,2,1,1,This was such a cute read. It was filled with culture and sci fi which are my favourites. I loved it.
514,4,4,0,"I do not normally like historical fiction, but this beautiful work is artful and insightful. The pace of the writing and the glimpses of life in revolutionary England and Belgium feel very real and alive, like a Merchant and Ivory movie or an old BBC Masterpiece Theater piece. And the portrait of Margaret of Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, her experiences, her thinking and her writing are poignantly expressed in elegant, thoughtful sketches. I am also reading Daniel Boorstin's The Discoverers and the personages in Stuart England and the age of Newton also show up here, coming delightfully alive. This is going on my favorites list."
172,3,3,0,"Some of the stuff with the painting seems a little slapdash but the rest of this book is so good that it makes up for that minor flaw. Great characters, very tense narrative. I was gripped and horrified by the details of Rosie and Norman's horrendous abusive marriage and really enjoyed the structure of the book: the chapters alternate between Rosie establishing a new life in hiding and Norman pursuing her to kill her. Norman is a great antagonist and the protagonist is very engaging. Good supporting characters and scene setting as well."
174,3,3,0,"Consistently entertaining and engaging though somewhat cliched at points. Character development was pretty strong and the prose was good. However, I can't help but wonder if this book would have been different if it came out after Dave Cullen's myth shattering book about Columbine, because this author seemed very wedded to a causal explanation of school shootings that seems a bit dated. This was pretty predictable. Marred by a really stupid twist at the end."
662,2,2,0,"Great book. A sci-fi classic. The fact that Gibson wrote this in 1984 is very impressive, as he makes many predictions that seem like they are coming true (was that a prediction?"

592,4,4,0,"One of the most amazing things about this book was that in spite of knowing the ending, it was suspenseful through and through. The second amazing thing is that it explained rowing to someone who had no clue (me) and little interest in sports in such a way that it was clear but not too much. The story of the road to the Olympics is told mostly from the perspective of Joe Rantz;however, as he requested, it is told in the context of ""the boat""--more than the shell that they propelled with oars, ""the boat"" is the spirit of the team working together in perfect harmony. The physical boat too is a character, and Pocock, its maker, stands out as one filled with wisdom about people as well as rowing and boat building. The story is told in the context of the Depression, the Dust Bowl, and the drums of encroaching World War II. Joe's surmounting of personal struggles as well as economic is admirable."
607,4,4,0,"Many of these stories are effused with the lingering emotional aftermath of the unspoken war just ended. An ineffable sense of mourning plays through the words and actions of broken or confused ex-soldiers interacting with untouched civilians. Other stories carry a long melancholic nostalgia for childhood innocence, or a just a nostalgic melancholy, with small jokes and odd details to lighten the mood, a contrast of adult versus child, a crushed innocence. I very much liked the fact that the book cover is exactly the same design as the one that sat on my father's shelf when I was a boy, thus invoking in me my own melancholic nostalgia."
629,3,2,1,"I liked it but I was a bit disappointed. Probably because I came into this book with high expectations. I think I liked this book more than I would have if I hadn't been required to analyze and answer questions on it for English class. All the symbols, motifs, and themes probably would have flown over my head."
868,1,1,0,Review to come soon....
720,2,2,0,"3.5 stars. (I'm actually still unsure whether to rate this 3 or 4 stars but I'll just go with 4 for now, but honestly it really is 3.5) This book kind of dragged in the middle-end but other than that I was pretty invested. I mean, who isn't interested in romantic drama? Also, while I was reading this all I could think about is the fact that boys were just as much fuckboy-y in the early 19th century as they are today."
315,2,2,0,"Lincoln = <3 I love the way this story is told. I love every single character in it. I love the humor, the writing, the pop culture references, the struggles everybody is going through individually. Just. Awesome."
44,3,3,0,"A fun trash read. This book is pretty corny and ridiculous: full of stilted dialogue, florid prose, and (to put it mildly) certain implausibilities in both plot and characterization. I admire how boldly crazy it is and I admit I became entranced by this bizarre world. Hardly the height of literary quality but a cool, enjoyable read nonetheless."
480,1,1,0,January 22nd.... 17 more days!
30,4,3,1,"I'm a goof about reading my son's school books, I guess. That's why I read this, this, wondrous coming-of-adulthood tale of woe that befalls plain Ed Kennedy. The pace is excellent, and while I had an idea where it was going, I also appreciated the curves in the road. Delightful scenery, that, Mr. Zusak. The end felt a bit abrupt, but by then I was quite taken by the messenger, and I can forgive a hastily tied plot hole if the rest seems seamless."
750,2,2,0,"I didn't know how much I needed this reread until I started reading this book again. Fangirl is just one of those books that understands you, and I'm so happy that I could read this book as a junior in high school and a junior in college and love it for the same and for different reasons."
501,1,1,0,"3.5 stars, 8th&up Enjoyable series, & I'm hooked enough to be in it at least until this sibling nonsense is resolved. Please tell me it's nonsense, otherwise...(shudder)"
379,1,1,0,Cold and dull.
908,1,1,0,Did someone say steam punk? Count me in.
860,1,1,0,Great Book!! Too short for my liking... but definitely prepare the tissue box near you when you start reading.
533,2,2,0,"I honestly don't understand what people don't like about this book. I was expecting it to be terrible, espically because I find that I'm often not satisfied with the endings to series, but I loved every minute of this one. It was definitly creepier and more graphic, but I thought that it did a great job of explaining all of the shit that went down in the first two books. I honestly wasn't expecting to get that much closure. This was truly a spectacular series and a great ending to a great series."
167,3,4,1,"I found the first half of this book underwhelming: I thought too much time was spent in the present, which was very generic chick lit, and some aspects of the time travel bugged me (how easily the men accepted the presence of a time traveling modern woman and how incurious they were about the future, how neither Eva or Daniel struggle much with time travel logistically and/or philosophically). However I must confess the second half of the book won me over with its charm and sweetness, despite the narrative problems. This books grows on you, and Eva and Daniel have a blessedly warm, non-annoying romance. It is sort of thin and shallow but also genuinely heartwarming so I give it three stars for the emotional engagement I felt with the second half of the narrative and for the beautiful descriptions of Cornwall."
797,1,1,0,This sounds awesome.
110,3,3,0,"Jake and his girlfriend are traveling to a remote farm so that she can meet his parents for the first time. Unfortunately for Jake, during the drive his (unnamed) girlfriend has basically come to the internal conclusion that she needs to end things with him. Unfortunately for her, she would have been much better off if she had come to that realization before the family dinner, before the detour, before things went very, very wrong. This is a wonderfully eerie and surprising little book that will keep you thinking long after the final conclusion. This book was obtained at BEA16 in exchange for an honest review."
520,3,2,1,"Loved every second, and didn't want it to end, so I had to find a book store and buy the next two! Its a Harry Potter reading level and similar type fantasy story, but sometimes thats what you need on a long flight to NYC for the holidays! I think as a child we all daydreamed about alternate worlds, so I love how thats the basis for the book. Thinking about all the permutations of how things could turn out differently is kinda fun :) I think if I had a Daemon I would hope she'd settle on being a lynx."
679,2,2,0,"LOVED THIS BOOK. LOVED the characters, and that the heroine is older. The ending is a little drawn out though. Still great book."

88,2,2,0,I love Uncle Stevie so I really gave this the old college try. I tried so hard to like it but a) the plot moves at a brutally sluggish pace and b) the way too large ensemble cast is composed of boring characters that are largely impossible to distinguish from each other.
383,1,2,1,Staggeringly pointless. I don't think I have ever read something with less content. There is absolutely nothing here.
755,2,2,0,"A delightful, highly readable stroll through the creation of the OED with some small asides to period London and surgeons in the Civil War. Good for leisurely summer reading."
690,2,2,0,Deeply troubling. Deeply moving. Moves inexorably to its end.
794,2,2,0,"I was really looking forward to this because I needed a good scare and it's been a long since I'd read a good horror novel. Maybe it's just me, but I wasn't frightened in the least. The story was not bad at all but I didn't really get what I wanted from this book."
719,2,1,1,"2.5 stars. This book was okay. The series overall was really disappointing...And Jesus Tobias and Tris were so annoying with their stupid angsty romance. Christ, they had sex like 5 times in this book..."
561,1,2,1,"(This, and the whole series) Needs a re-read. This was my shit in middle school but all the hate has distorted my views of this book series (phenomena, really) and I need a refresh to form my own opinion. Thus, I've abstained from rating any books in this series until I reread them again. Back when I first read them, they all would have been 5 stars. After I thought it was ""cool"" to hate on this, they'd be 2 stars. The new rating will reflect my current opinion."
375,1,1,0,the writing was beautiful but I'm not sure about the story.
177,3,3,0,"Not nearly as strong as the first two books. Overly long, very repetitive. This is overloaded with dead end subplots and boring retreads of stuff already done better in the first two books. I was fine with how everyone ultimately ended up, but it was such a drag to get there. However, I was pleasantly surprised and very glad that (big spoiler about the ending under the tag)  the protagonist's love interest dies at the end both because I thought that was a bold and novel choice and because he was such an annoying character and their relationship was implausible."
680,2,2,0,"Ok so I'll say it... At first I was a little unsure how I felt about the book, since Gemma kept going back and forth on her decision making.. It was kind of getting annoying. But.... That twist blew me away,( still not sure how I feel about it though) . So yes it's a must read simply because that twist was so not expected!"

248,2,2,0,"I wish I could say this was the book that would make me die anticipating the next, but it isn't. Right now I'm rather glad I got it cheap. Even for urban fantasy it's plot was implausible, and the love triangle wasn't erotic, it was yucky. I'm of only one mind here---if a fourteen y/o is going to have sex in this series, it better damn well happen with another child--not a full-out man. I think I'll check out Burned when it's on the shelves...of my library."
491,1,1,0,I LOOOVEDDDDDD this one.
35,3,3,0,"Another strong installment in the Mistborn series. I thought the plot took a while to get going but once it did it was quite interesting and the characters remain compelling. I loved everything about the villain in this book, a great character with fascinating motivations. I also appreciated all the detail about the difficulties of industrialization in Elendel."
873,1,1,0,"Fun read! But I must say... with that ending, there better be another book coming soon!"
603,4,4,0,"This well written update to Catcher in the Rye depicts the confusion of high schoolers trying to find their way into adulthood. At first I mistook ""wall flower"" as code for a gay character, but it turns out that the author character is only a wimp, a soft-hearted crybaby, who I am surprised is not beaten, or at least ostracized by the end of the story, because that is the likely result of such a personality at my high school, which pre-dates the era in which this was written. And Ohio, my home state, is not far, or different, from Pennsylvania. Of course, he has to be soft-hearted in order to get away with some of the scenes he is witness to here. Nonetheless, he does a decent job of teasing out the small hypocrisies, the animal instincts, and most of all the sadness of the whole high school experience."

517,3,3,0,"Very well-written; excellent character development. In several spots, the extended time spent completing the book (which Johnson refers to in her Acknowledgments) is evident: for example, Facebook no longer has ""walls,"" there are absolutely no public telephones available anywhere in 2017, and my biggest personal complaint,  no teacher, especially not a 23 year old college grad, should need ""cyberbullying"" announced to them as if the term is new or unfamiliar. Overall, an excellent view inside the lives, minds, and hearts of teens today."

511,4,4,0,"I have endless respect and admiration for David Levithan. His books are so meaningful and so beautiful. I loved getting to see a different perspective on Every Day, since it was one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. While this book wasn't quite as perfect as the original (and I never expected it to be), Rhiannon's POV still proved to be insightful and was written with the same literary excellence. I will say that I was uncomfortable with the amount of infidelity in this book, because I don't believe that cheating on a partner is ever really justified. I think now more than ever, I really need the sequel to A's story."
903,1,2,1,3.5stars. Not as good as the first one until the middle end of the book but still good none the less. The ending is just as vague and infuriating though (although that could be me just being dramatic).
601,4,1,1,"The pace is slower than Hobbit and there is much more scenery, but the story somehow manages to hold one's interest. There is an adventure underneath the overgrowth; and perhaps there is some use for this surfeit of nature--like the green of the surrounding garden, a comfortable home (as per Japanese architecture) is not complete if it does not interact with its environment. The power of the Ring is well depicted--my sons would sometimes scream in warning as Frodo fingered the ring, ""Don't put on the ring!!!"" Thank you for the memories, J.R.R."
290,2,3,1,"For this review and more Live Read and Breathe I know some people have said that it was too much sex and not enough story but I have to disagree on that one. Even though there was a LOT of sex I felt like that was part of the story of Bennett and Chloe. Bennett and Chloe were so much alike that created such a hate/love relationship between the two that the only outlet valve was pure hot raw sex. Once that valve was opened they were able to really see each other for what they are and what they mean to each other. I liked the love story part of it and I especially liked the very raw, unhibitied sex scenes between the two."
310,2,2,0,"I don't know what was about this book that made me like it so much. It isn't the best of Stephen King, it didn't impress me AT ALL, but after I finished, I keep missing Dev so much! I was unhappy for a while for wasn't be able to know about him anymore and sighing everytime I thought about him. I don't think this book is amazing, brilliant or anything like that, but the way it make me feel about Devin - even so long after I finished the book - deserve a five star rating."
194,3,2,1,"This is a perfect little book detailing the events of one summer from the perspective of 10-year-old Helen. She reminds me so much of myself at that age: clever, headstrong, and always so sure that she's right about everything. I enjoyed getting to know her and remember what it was like to be a girl just beginning to grow up."
686,2,2,0,"Although it is long, it was hard to find a place to put it down. Some very interesting characters, especially the women."
849,1,1,0,"One of the best books I have read, not to be missed. Great story and characters. And it's hot"
519,3,2,1,"This should be 3.5 stars. I really enjoyed it, but found it all kind of random and leading nowhere. That being said, it was very imaginative and entertaining. Hrun the Barbarian was one of my favorites, as was anything the Luggage did."
955,1,1,0,"R.I.P. Ms. Harper Lee, Feb. Thank you for writing one of the great American novels."
512,4,4,0,"Absolutely captivating. Once you begin reading, you won't be able to put it down. One tells the story of a set of conjoined twins who, against all odds, have made it into their teens. Homeschooled for their entire lives, hard times have forced the family to send them to public school for the first time. The fact that One is written completely in free verse poetry adds power and emotion to the story and pulls the reader in. One tells a heartbreaking but important story of acceptance and love that is perfect for fans of The Fault in Our Stars, If I Stay, and All the Bright Places."
728,2,2,0,"...disappointed at all the hype this book had but I guess it just wasn't the book for me. If I had to describe it in one word, PRETENTIOUS. Also, it didn't help that halfway through the book I was extremely bored and I had to FORCE myself to finish it...maybe I'm missing something?"
973,1,1,0,very well written ... more later
917,1,1,0,"Love the show on Netflix, hopefully the book will be good too."
340,2,3,1,"3.5 stars I didn't realize at first that this is an extension of the Dark Protector series, which I did not complete. While most readers would not find this to be a stumbling block, that sort of thing drives me crazy- I always feel haunted by what I'm missing. Aside from that, the story was HOT and fast-paced, with intriguing characters that I enjoyed spending time with. I did feel that at times the hero was (dare I say...) a bit too Neanderthal. Still, a solid start to Zanetti's new series."
760,2,2,0,"My three year old loved, LOVED, this book so much that afterwards we started role playing, with me as the Station Inspector and him as Hugo Cabret. Highly recommend."
123,1,1,0,"Read this many years ago, a superb book that changed my attitude to both war and humour (I was only 14!)"
303,2,2,0,"Pleasing and clever, especially with the use of the first-person to hide information, but probably not something I would have picked up on its own merits; what's been recommended to me is the series as a whole."
880,1,1,0,AWESOME READ!! FULL REVIEW TO COME
741,2,2,0,Loved this book. I'm just enjoying this whole world and these stories so much. There were so many brilliant and creative bits in this book that just really really made me appreciate Meyer as an author and a genius. I'm so excited to start Cress soon (and for more Thorne).
644,3,2,1,"I read this once in high school, and re-read it to my boys this year. It is wonderful--the pacing is good, the adventure unique and the main characters admirable (and loveable). We have now moved on to Fellowship of the Ring."
190,3,2,1,"I really ought to read this book again, but I have a very strong memory of flipping back through it after finishing the first time trying to figure out what the heck had just been going on. This book seemed to have several different stories in it, each following on from the previous one without resolving anything whatsoever from it, which just, I have to say, drove me nuts. They were all good and interesting stories, too, and I'd really like to know how they end! Maybe there's resolution in there that I just missed, but I'm not sure I could take the disappointment a second time if there isn't."
102,1,1,0,"If you look up the word ""love story"" in the dictionary, this book should be under the definition for it. It is an absolutely beautiful story about undying love. Amazing. ""Now you and I both know that I'll wait a lifetime for you- remember, Butterfly Weeds never give up..."" ""As for the war, I surrendered."" <3 This is still making me cry."
657,3,3,0,"Really enjoyed this one. It is not as good as the Eona Duology but this first book is obviously meant to set the foundation for the coming 2 books and as such, was slow at times but I didn't even find the slow bits to be tedious or anything of the sort and the story really picks up a fast pace in the last 200 pages or so. I genuinely can't wait to see where Goodman takes this story, it has such great potential. And as usual, the attention to historical detail is astounding. Goodman draws from real historical characters and events and I really admire a well-researched story."
569,2,2,0,Everything we believe about pirates comes from this story. Yo-ho-ho! And Long John Silver is a character like no other--except perhaps the Devil himself in Paradise Lost. Rip-roaring adventure!
857,1,1,0,"Loved this, loved Knight, but not as much of a detailed story as her other books. Read this one first but like Motorcycle Man better."
426,1,2,1,[image error] I am sorry but I felt like this book was all over the place and I was WTF ing the whole way through. I tried to like it but I just couldn't
964,1,1,0,Read for class
296,2,3,1,"I just love these books. To quote Joel: ""This is an excellent wrap-up to Lisbeth's story and the trilogy, leaving exactly one thread hanging, and a small one at that, which is remarkable considerng it's number three in a planned run of 10. It leaves Mikael and Lisbeth in a great place, and pays off pretty much everything that was established over the previous two books. That it does so with a histrionic courtroom scene, all the better. """

994,1,1,0,Listened to audiobook.
224,2,2,0,It must be exhausting to have that much imagination to be able to write such a long story from so many different perspectives... and then to go on to write several other books equally as long and complicated. I loved it :)
693,2,2,0,I remember trying 3 times to read this but I always gave up on page 3 or so. So I skipped to book 2 and then read the whole series then came back to this book. It's hard to review this book without taking in the series a as a whole.
236,2,2,0,"Pretty good until now, I am still at the beginning though. But I like the way it is written and the characters are awesome!"
353,1,1,0,I love Four. I want more!
238,2,2,0,"thought this was the best short story by far - shorter than the others but much better in terms of character development, moving on the story and the messaging behind it all."
566,2,2,0,"Ending happened a little fast for me, but I loved the style and felt like the telling of the story was creative. Stylistically, one of the more interesting and engaging books I've read this year."

227,2,3,1,"Despite whatever, I am very affected. I am incredibly sad. I can hear see and witnessed the scenes, and despite it end the way it should, I wish it didn't. I wish there's alternate ending that would let me not see those scenes repeatedly. Oh, and this story is good. The second book was a bit boring, but the whole plot is good."
540,4,4,0,"3.5 stars A well-plotted story that reveals complex characters layer by ever-deepening layer, much as one might come to know persons in the real world, All the Missing Girls was a satisfying read. Although the reverse chronology worked for me for the most part, I found it annoying just past the midpoint of the book for 50 pages or so. However, the plot was compelling enough that I moved past that section/emotion - I'm not sure if that experience was related to the content or simply my tolerance - and regained the sense of being engaged and invested."
985,1,1,0,4.5 stars Listened to audiobook.
743,2,2,0,This was a fantastic (yet heartbreaking) conclusion to my favorite duology. Leigh Bardugo proves that you don't need very many books to write a captivating and well-structured series. The ending was bittersweet but still completely satisfying.
432,1,1,0,This book was dark and disheartening but still profound and deep.
221,3,3,0,"8th&up, 3.5 stars This bittersweet, suspenseful time travel romance should have plenty of appeal for teen readers. Cassie, the modern heroine, shows a lot of character growth as she changes from self-centered whiner to a confident and determined woman. Lawrence, the dreamy young man from the 1920s, goes through changes as well when he realizes that his world has a dark side that he must fight against if he is to stay true to his dreams and his heart. This book was obtained at BEA15 in exchange for an honest review."
702,2,2,0,"*I originially rated this 2 stars, but thinking back on this book I can't remember anything about it except that it was pretty boring, so rating has been dropped to 1 stars* *Original Review* It was okay I guess. Hayley was pretty irritating and boy, was she BITTER. Finn was alright, he was one of those eccentric young adult male love interests (*cough* Augustus *cough*). I don't really know whether or not I actually ""liked"" this book or not..."

902,1,2,1,"I'm going to read this to finish up my dypstopian book challenge for 2013 but before I even open the book I'm going to predict, right now, that Ky is the person Cassia ends up with."
9,4,4,0,"I love the study series, I really do, but five books in, not only am I questioning how often the characters get captured, but so are they! It's starting to get a bit repetitive in that respect. The Yelena/Valek scenes still get me right in the feels though and I really enjoyed the minor arc where Valek's past catches up to him and the ensuing plot twist that results. This feels very much like a ""second of a trilogy"" book - it's building to something huge and almost epic in the third, setting up some very high expectations. I'm desperately hoping Snyder can pull off what's needed for the scope of the conflict and still resolve everything in a satisfying way. As much as I love the characters and the world in the Study and Glass series, I would love to see Snyder turn her talents to something new after she finishes Dawn Study."
554,2,2,0,"Kristen did it again! The story of Frankie and Benny was just simply absolutely AMAZING!!! I could not put it down, so much so when finished I picked up the other burg books and started re-reading it to remember all the burg history. So if you haven't yet read it be sure to do sooo !!!"
665,2,2,0,One of my top 5 favorites. Read this at the deeper/figuring your life out moments - it will give you strength and inspiration.
26,2,2,0,I think I read a different book to everyone else. I was cringing every other sentence. I really enjoyed the first couple of books and then it just seemed to get away from the author. Perhaps I'm just getting older and more cynical with it. The ending just seemed way too easy. And I can't be bothered to say much else.
22,2,4,1,"I remember reading this in my early teens. While I don't remember everything in it I remember it really screwed with my head, in a good way. I was unaware it was part of a series and I'm kind of disappointed to find that out. The first worked well when I thought of it as a stand alone and I fear to read them or go back and reread this with the risk of tainting my fond memories of the first time I read it with my grown-up knowledge of quality books. But knowing there are sequels urges me to go back and revisit the series and I suspect I will revisit this series eventually. I suppose this review must serve as a reminder to myself that I did enjoy this book even if rereading does end up souring those memories."
31,3,3,0,"I really enjoyed this one. 16 y/o Janelle is a caretaker to her family due to a bipolar mother and a workaholic father. Her sense of responsibility is never damped, even when she inexplicably survives being killed in the opening. We all hear how an author has to make life hard for the character, and this book is filled with one tough choice after another. Fans of the ""it all works out"" shiny happy ending will not be satisfied, though the resolution is satisfying."
325,2,2,0,"It's hard for me to rate this book, because it's very clear when you come to the end that the second volume will be a continuation of the same story. Still, I will say that Valente is very clever (and sometimes maddening) in the way she has entwined all these stories together. I can't wait to start the second volume, but at the same time, I'm a little leery of going into the lion's den again!"
923,1,1,0,"4.5 stars. Man, can this guy write."
104,1,2,1,"It's hard to find a Gothic novel set in the very recent past that works, but this one fits the bill nicely. I want to go live in Black Rabbit Hall, as long as someone else pays for the repairs!"
967,1,1,0,There are no words. There will never be sufficient words ever again.
605,4,4,0,"A creepy Lolita-like tale brought wittily up to date by a very sharp writer. Although some of the scenes are a touch too graphic for my tastes, the unfailing narcissism and blindness of the protagonist propel the story and the humor forward through increasingly you-have-got-to-be-kidding plot developments. The pages are filled with insightful, quirky, dark humor. And there is a sadness flowing through the narration that is barely visible until the very last scenes when there is a sense of boundless devastation. Although in the story there is only one prosecution, in the course of the narrative, everyone, society included, is indicted."
234,2,2,0,Easy to read. Boring. Pretentious. Unrealistic. Left me unmoved and a little annoyed.
1000,1,1,0,"Would be very interesting to reread, especially after rereading The Great Gatsby."
738,2,2,0,Completely loved the start to this series. It captivated me in a way that reminded me of when I first started the City of Bones series. I loved the characters and this magical world is like nothing I've ever read before. I can't wait to see where this story goes from here.
272,2,2,0,"This is just terrible all around. The plot is stupid, the characters are bland cliches, and the writing itself is colorless and dull."
456,1,2,1,"Meh. It's an interesting world, but the helplessness of the central female character grated."
712,2,1,1,"Um. Can I have the second book now? Pretty please? Seriously, this was the first book in MONTHS that I have read in less than a day. It was just that compelling and interesting. Can't wait for the next book!"
2,3,2,1,"In a way I never expected it, this topped the first book. My eyes are so sore of crying now and my heart feels like it has been ripped from my chest. Lucien being my favorite in the first book has been replaced by Arziel and Cassian although I do have a lot of love for Rhys too. I just love my Illyrian boys. Although I am physically sore from reading this book, I haven't read such an awesome story in years. Definitely recommend this book to any and every YA reader"
785,2,2,0,"Great introduction of this world I've been a JLA fan for several years, but somehow never got around to reading this series. After this prequel I'm ready to dive in. I really loved Jas as a character and found her very relatable."
780,2,2,0,"What a heroine! I could not put this down! Distilled amorallity wrapped up in beauty, a desire for material goods. No, I guess things can not make you happy, but maybe you don't even care."
622,3,2,1,"A powerfully written story that will take your breath away. You will not be able to tear yourself away from the story of Sophie and Ian. The writing is flawless and the character development perfect. Unforgettable first-kiss scene! Seriously, this book needs to be made into a movie. Put this at the top of your to-read list for 2013."
443,1,1,0,I liked this book will have review up on blog and here in a few days. Just got back from holidays so catching up.

855,1,1,0,"Fantastic book. Couldn't put it down. Ranks up there with Bared to You, Gabriel's Inferno and 50 Shades. You will not be disappointed."
914,1,2,1,"Eh. Took me about a month to read this. Honestly, I was sort of uninterested. It MIGHT have been because I'd just finish playing the Last of Us. Quite frankly, I think that the story works better in video game form."
29,4,2,1,"My second favorite of the epic series. Claire's adventures in in 17th century Scotland are lush and memorable. Yes, there is strife, witch hunts, and sadistic army captains, but there is love, too. Lots of it. Jamie Fraser is the stuff men should be made of."
499,1,2,1,"Enjoyed this, the culture is best enjoyed in its dealings with other societies. Certainly the books tend to be far more fun."
96,1,2,1,"I'm not quite sure what I expected from this book, but that wasn't it. I'm really impressed in a lot of ways with the protagonist of this book, and I think I'm going to be a while unpacking that into something that's more of a review, but there you go anyway. I'm awfully glad that there's not a long wait for the sequel."
214,3,3,0,"Detective Barry Duckworth doesn't know which way to turn. Recently trouble has haunted Promise Falls, and now a mysterious and deadly illness has spread like wildfire all across the little town. When signs begin to point to a deliberate act of terror, Duckworth wonders if someone has decided that the time has come for the people of Promise Falls to pay for past sins. The Twenty-Three opens with a bang and keeps moving fast and furious throughout. Previous visitors to this creepy little town will be more than satisfied with the twists and turns that Barclay serves up. This book was obtained though NetGalley, with thanks to Berkley Publishing Group, in exchange for an honest review."
807,1,1,0,Listened it on tape on a road trip... thoroughly enjoyed it!
388,1,1,0,Re-read August 2016.
667,2,2,0,"This might be the most deliciously dirty Alexa Riley story ever. I mean, look at the plot, ""stepdad"" and ""stepbrother"" want to f*k the teenager living with them in their trailer. But it's all very sweet and in good fun even though it is nasty and totally forbidden! If you have about 1/2 hour to spare, prepare yourself for a fun, filthy, sexy, erotic story. Loved it!"
483,1,1,0,I am in love with this story and these characters.
460,1,2,1,"I read it online, at Subterranean Magazine, after I saw the Nebula nominees list had a link for it. Like most Ted Chiang stories, I need to think about it for a while to even know where to start pondering!"
779,2,2,0,"The same scene told from different view points, steam of consciousness writing, all linking together. Like an LSD trip--really takes you away. Read it late at night sipping a little something."
507,4,3,1,"This story had so much promise! And I love Whitney G. 's writing style; in fact, Turbulence was one of my favorite books this year. This was a cute, fast read BUT several typos later and a heroine who sends sexually explicit emails from her work account and I'm out. Moving on with high hopes for this author's next book. Call me an eternal optimist."
120,2,3,1,"I adore this book! If it wasn't for one thing, this book would have been perfect. But nothing bothers me most than when a ""sex scene"" is used wrongly, like when are in a life threatening trouble and they decide to fornicate anyway because the sex tension is unbearable. It just makes me mad. But past that, Alexia is a great character -incredible funny and witty and the right ""sex scenes"" make me giggle Obviously the book is so much more than that, a well paranormal intriguing story with an also great plot full of humor."
261,2,2,0,"There were many cool bits of writing in this book. However, despite some great scenes/situations I had problems with how the book was paced."
64,2,3,1,"You know a story is perfectly executed when you have never experienced the kind of life the main character is living, yet you find that you relate to her (or in this case, many of them). Told through various POVs and staying true to its name, this story was ugly, wonderful, and most of all moving."
782,2,2,0,"This idiot is a true idiot, in the style of a sort of warmed over Jesus type, but incanting a sort of ""can't we all get along?"" refrain while pining over a girl of questionable morals (for the day) and plotting against a rival. Many funny moments, which keep it going."

137,4,3,1,"Everyone knows the basics of the true story of Lizzie Borden and the scandalous murder of her father and stepmother, but Sarah Schmidt delves into that event with a chilling and slippery tale that offers new perspective to the old tale. Readers will be drawn down into the madness of the Borden household, and they'll be left wondering about the full truth of the event until the final pages. Thanks to Atlantic/Ingram for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
