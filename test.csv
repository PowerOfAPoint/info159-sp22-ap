899.0,"April 17, 2014 : Wow that suspense update : April 12, 2014: After 2 years, I'm going to try this book again, now that the trilogy just ended a few days ago. I hope I'll like it more and maybe I'll also get into it. (Probably because I was 12 years old when I was trying to read this...too young.) this book wasn't my type of genre, i suppose ... i got bored, but it did seem interesting and i hope i'll try to read it again."
383.0,Staggeringly pointless. I don't think I have ever read something with less content. There is absolutely nothing here.
561.0,"(This, and the whole series) Needs a re-read. This was my shit in middle school but all the hate has distorted my views of this book series (phenomena, really) and I need a refresh to form my own opinion. Thus, I've abstained from rating any books in this series until I reread them again. Back when I first read them, they all would have been 5 stars. After I thought it was ""cool"" to hate on this, they'd be 2 stars. The new rating will reflect my current opinion."
816.0,"Deviant, dark and delicious!! I need more Fiona and Deacon as soon as possible. Full review to follow."
903.0,3.5stars. Not as good as the first one until the middle end of the book but still good none the less. The ending is just as vague and infuriating though (although that could be me just being dramatic).
426.0,[image error] I am sorry but I felt like this book was all over the place and I was WTF ing the whole way through. I tried to like it but I just couldn't
902.0,"I'm going to read this to finish up my dypstopian book challenge for 2013 but before I even open the book I'm going to predict, right now, that Ky is the person Cassia ends up with."
104.0,"It's hard to find a Gothic novel set in the very recent past that works, but this one fits the bill nicely. I want to go live in Black Rabbit Hall, as long as someone else pays for the repairs!"
456.0,"Meh. It's an interesting world, but the helplessness of the central female character grated."
914.0,"Eh. Took me about a month to read this. Honestly, I was sort of uninterested. It MIGHT have been because I'd just finish playing the Last of Us. Quite frankly, I think that the story works better in video game form."
499.0,"Enjoyed this, the culture is best enjoyed in its dealings with other societies. Certainly the books tend to be far more fun."
96.0,"I'm not quite sure what I expected from this book, but that wasn't it. I'm really impressed in a lot of ways with the protagonist of this book, and I think I'm going to be a while unpacking that into something that's more of a review, but there you go anyway. I'm awfully glad that there's not a long wait for the sequel."
460.0,"I read it online, at Subterranean Magazine, after I saw the Nebula nominees list had a link for it. Like most Ted Chiang stories, I need to think about it for a while to even know where to start pondering!"
