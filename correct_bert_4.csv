598.0,"This is the best book I've read in a really really long time. I could feel myself slipping into a reading slump and I'm so thankful I picked this book up when I did because it managed to engage me like no other book I've read in a seriously long time. The best thing about this book is that it's so completely unique and different than anything I've ever read. Usually, I'm always drawing connections in my mind between books while I'm reading but this book really created a world of its own. I had absolutely no idea where the plot was headed or how things would resolve and I didn't see any of the plot twists coming, which is really rare for me because I've found that lately I usually always can tell where books are headed and see the plot twists coming before the main character. Despite the very dark tone of this book, Sabaa Tahir's writing style is so elegant and the themes and characters in this book were so beautiful."
132.0,"A good read but definitely my least favorite Mistborn novel. I have really come to care for these characters (in particular I love Steris with an unholy love) and their relationships to each other and there were definitely some cool concepts/plot twists but I also found the book way too action heavy and the third act ""twist"" involving a certain character's behavior/alliances didn't pack the emotional punch for me I think Sanderson wanted it to. There was so much interesting information about the politics of Elendel in the last volume, I really missed that this time around. I feel like the other Mistborn books all have a lot more going on then what is essentially a quest for magical artifact/heist narrative. I still look forward to how Sanderson is going to wrap up this installment of the Mistborn saga in the next book."
5.0,"Awesome as usually the case with this author. What I loved most about this book was how morally complex it was. As terrible as North Carolina's eugenics program was, I can see how even well intentioned people could have designed and implemented it. Chamberlain eschewed melodrama and avoided painting characters as two-dimensional heroes and villains. She did a great job creating distinctive narrative voices for Ivy and Jane as well. Pretty much impossible to put down once you start."
514.0,"I do not normally like historical fiction, but this beautiful work is artful and insightful. The pace of the writing and the glimpses of life in revolutionary England and Belgium feel very real and alive, like a Merchant and Ivory movie or an old BBC Masterpiece Theater piece. And the portrait of Margaret of Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, her experiences, her thinking and her writing are poignantly expressed in elegant, thoughtful sketches. I am also reading Daniel Boorstin's The Discoverers and the personages in Stuart England and the age of Newton also show up here, coming delightfully alive. This is going on my favorites list."
592.0,"One of the most amazing things about this book was that in spite of knowing the ending, it was suspenseful through and through. The second amazing thing is that it explained rowing to someone who had no clue (me) and little interest in sports in such a way that it was clear but not too much. The story of the road to the Olympics is told mostly from the perspective of Joe Rantz;however, as he requested, it is told in the context of ""the boat""--more than the shell that they propelled with oars, ""the boat"" is the spirit of the team working together in perfect harmony. The physical boat too is a character, and Pocock, its maker, stands out as one filled with wisdom about people as well as rowing and boat building. The story is told in the context of the Depression, the Dust Bowl, and the drums of encroaching World War II. Joe's surmounting of personal struggles as well as economic is admirable."
607.0,"Many of these stories are effused with the lingering emotional aftermath of the unspoken war just ended. An ineffable sense of mourning plays through the words and actions of broken or confused ex-soldiers interacting with untouched civilians. Other stories carry a long melancholic nostalgia for childhood innocence, or a just a nostalgic melancholy, with small jokes and odd details to lighten the mood, a contrast of adult versus child, a crushed innocence. I very much liked the fact that the book cover is exactly the same design as the one that sat on my father's shelf when I was a boy, thus invoking in me my own melancholic nostalgia."
603.0,"This well written update to Catcher in the Rye depicts the confusion of high schoolers trying to find their way into adulthood. At first I mistook ""wall flower"" as code for a gay character, but it turns out that the author character is only a wimp, a soft-hearted crybaby, who I am surprised is not beaten, or at least ostracized by the end of the story, because that is the likely result of such a personality at my high school, which pre-dates the era in which this was written. And Ohio, my home state, is not far, or different, from Pennsylvania. Of course, he has to be soft-hearted in order to get away with some of the scenes he is witness to here. Nonetheless, he does a decent job of teasing out the small hypocrisies, the animal instincts, and most of all the sadness of the whole high school experience."
511.0,"I have endless respect and admiration for David Levithan. His books are so meaningful and so beautiful. I loved getting to see a different perspective on Every Day, since it was one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever read. While this book wasn't quite as perfect as the original (and I never expected it to be), Rhiannon's POV still proved to be insightful and was written with the same literary excellence. I will say that I was uncomfortable with the amount of infidelity in this book, because I don't believe that cheating on a partner is ever really justified. I think now more than ever, I really need the sequel to A's story."
512.0,"Absolutely captivating. Once you begin reading, you won't be able to put it down. One tells the story of a set of conjoined twins who, against all odds, have made it into their teens. Homeschooled for their entire lives, hard times have forced the family to send them to public school for the first time. The fact that One is written completely in free verse poetry adds power and emotion to the story and pulls the reader in. One tells a heartbreaking but important story of acceptance and love that is perfect for fans of The Fault in Our Stars, If I Stay, and All the Bright Places."
540.0,"3.5 stars A well-plotted story that reveals complex characters layer by ever-deepening layer, much as one might come to know persons in the real world, All the Missing Girls was a satisfying read. Although the reverse chronology worked for me for the most part, I found it annoying just past the midpoint of the book for 50 pages or so. However, the plot was compelling enough that I moved past that section/emotion - I'm not sure if that experience was related to the content or simply my tolerance - and regained the sense of being engaged and invested."
9.0,"I love the study series, I really do, but five books in, not only am I questioning how often the characters get captured, but so are they! It's starting to get a bit repetitive in that respect. The Yelena/Valek scenes still get me right in the feels though and I really enjoyed the minor arc where Valek's past catches up to him and the ensuing plot twist that results. This feels very much like a ""second of a trilogy"" book - it's building to something huge and almost epic in the third, setting up some very high expectations. I'm desperately hoping Snyder can pull off what's needed for the scope of the conflict and still resolve everything in a satisfying way. As much as I love the characters and the world in the Study and Glass series, I would love to see Snyder turn her talents to something new after she finishes Dawn Study."
605.0,"A creepy Lolita-like tale brought wittily up to date by a very sharp writer. Although some of the scenes are a touch too graphic for my tastes, the unfailing narcissism and blindness of the protagonist propel the story and the humor forward through increasingly you-have-got-to-be-kidding plot developments. The pages are filled with insightful, quirky, dark humor. And there is a sadness flowing through the narration that is barely visible until the very last scenes when there is a sense of boundless devastation. Although in the story there is only one prosecution, in the course of the narrative, everyone, society included, is indicted."
