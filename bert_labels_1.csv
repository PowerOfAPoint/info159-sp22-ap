601.0,"The pace is slower than Hobbit and there is much more scenery, but the story somehow manages to hold one's interest. There is an adventure underneath the overgrowth; and perhaps there is some use for this surfeit of nature--like the green of the surrounding garden, a comfortable home (as per Japanese architecture) is not complete if it does not interact with its environment. The power of the Ring is well depicted--my sons would sometimes scream in warning as Frodo fingered the ring, ""Don't put on the ring!!!"" Thank you for the memories, J.R.R."
849.0,"One of the best books I have read, not to be missed. Great story and characters. And it's hot"

880.0,AWESOME READ!! FULL REVIEW TO COME
102.0,"If you look up the word ""love story"" in the dictionary, this book should be under the definition for it. It is an absolutely beautiful story about undying love. Amazing. ""Now you and I both know that I'll wait a lifetime for you- remember, Butterfly Weeds never give up..."" ""As for the war, I surrendered."" <3 This is still making me cry."
857.0,"Loved this, loved Knight, but not as much of a detailed story as her other books. Read this one first but like Motorcycle Man better."
