181.0,Well.....I liked the story and the personality of the characters. I loved how Alice brought everyone together. I also loved the unconventional family that she brought together. My only beef and it is only me because this is just a personal preference is that when I read I like more masculine leads with m/m. Rue and Erik were not my normal leads choice but the story was still sweet and I will read the next one to find out what happens next. I did love the quirkiness of Erik and how he over came so many challenges to finally be free of his own demons so he could find love.
516.0,"A charming, tea drinker's tale about the furtive and futile impulses of a collection of aging British upper-crusters and their household help; a collection of their scheming, their fears, their denials, and their consideration. Perhaps quite cutting edge in its day. Spoiler Alert: Everyone dies in the end."
57.0,"I liked the first novel in The Custard Protocol, but it seemed...more forced, I guess than this one. Perhaps, the characters are better able to stand on their own after the events of Prudence, which isn't a bad thing. In my mind, the characters grew more and were better able to step out of the shadows of their parent's shadows from The Parasol Protectorate series. I give this book Two Parasols Up! Very much enjoyed and I look forward to future installments."
524.0,"I love an erotic suspense and dark romance as much as the next person but this book just didn't quite do it for me. I literally felt dropped right into the middle of a story that had already begun, which was very disorienting. While many readers are raving about this book, for me there was no connection between the main characters and many of their actions felt mechanical, and the story, formulaic. I still would love to read the other books by this author, because their story lines sound very intriguing. Giving credit here for a very strong, kick-ass heroine, and a surprising ending. (ARC provided by the author in return for an honest review.)"
275.0,This book was awesome!! I loved how the author replicated the feeling of doing archival research by using multiple narrators as well as faux historical documents. Each character here was engaging and fully realized. I was completely engrossed in both the 19th and 21st century plot lines. It was hard to put this down. Highly recommended.
526.0,"3.5 Stars Kate McCarthy is a favorite author of mine but surprisingly this book just did not do it for me. Although the book features a very strong heroine and and a talented but tortured hero, which I loved, the plot of this book fell flat for me and the so-called scandal was absolutely not scandalous in my eyes at all. Lots of readers fell in love with this book so definitely give this one a try and judge for yourself. I adore Kate McCarthy (Redemption is one of my top favorites) and look forward to her next book!"
204.0,"Restaurant owner Violet and single father/barbecue phenom Hogan find their personal and professional lives entwined as they discover that the perfect mate is definitely worth waiting for. Foster is my go to author for sweet sexy romance with just a smidge of suspense- she never lets me down. The main romance, secondary romance, & even a third young love story thread are all balanced perfectly. Fans- especially ones who enjoyed Don't Tempt Me should put this novel on their must read list. Thank you to Harlequin and Netgalley for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
789.0,"Listened to audiobook. Characters are flat and predictable. The writing is uneven and uninspired. While I'm certain this shouldn't bother me as much as it did, what teenager today is named 'Olive'? I felt that every plot point was dealt with superficially, and there were so, so many. Including fewer and explorIng them in more depth might have enhanced the novel."
12.0,"4.5 stars! Block out some time and get comfortable, because Behind Her Eyes is the kind of thriller that you'll want to read in one sitting- and then maybe read again as you come to terms with the shocking twists and clever stylings of Pinborough's creation. Even veteran suspense fans will be surprised while they shadow slightly depressed single mother Louise as she finds herself drawn into the unsettling marriage dynamics between handsome David and secretive Adele. #WTFthatending indeed! Thank you to Macmillan and St. Martin's Press for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
172.0,"Some of the stuff with the painting seems a little slapdash but the rest of this book is so good that it makes up for that minor flaw. Great characters, very tense narrative. I was gripped and horrified by the details of Rosie and Norman's horrendous abusive marriage and really enjoyed the structure of the book: the chapters alternate between Rosie establishing a new life in hiding and Norman pursuing her to kill her. Norman is a great antagonist and the protagonist is very engaging. Good supporting characters and scene setting as well."
174.0,"Consistently entertaining and engaging though somewhat cliched at points. Character development was pretty strong and the prose was good. However, I can't help but wonder if this book would have been different if it came out after Dave Cullen's myth shattering book about Columbine, because this author seemed very wedded to a causal explanation of school shootings that seems a bit dated. This was pretty predictable. Marred by a really stupid twist at the end."
44.0,"A fun trash read. This book is pretty corny and ridiculous: full of stilted dialogue, florid prose, and (to put it mildly) certain implausibilities in both plot and characterization. I admire how boldly crazy it is and I admit I became entranced by this bizarre world. Hardly the height of literary quality but a cool, enjoyable read nonetheless."
30.0,"I'm a goof about reading my son's school books, I guess. That's why I read this, this, wondrous coming-of-adulthood tale of woe that befalls plain Ed Kennedy. The pace is excellent, and while I had an idea where it was going, I also appreciated the curves in the road. Delightful scenery, that, Mr. Zusak. The end felt a bit abrupt, but by then I was quite taken by the messenger, and I can forgive a hastily tied plot hole if the rest seems seamless."
110.0,"Jake and his girlfriend are traveling to a remote farm so that she can meet his parents for the first time. Unfortunately for Jake, during the drive his (unnamed) girlfriend has basically come to the internal conclusion that she needs to end things with him. Unfortunately for her, she would have been much better off if she had come to that realization before the family dinner, before the detour, before things went very, very wrong. This is a wonderfully eerie and surprising little book that will keep you thinking long after the final conclusion. This book was obtained at BEA16 in exchange for an honest review."
177.0,"Not nearly as strong as the first two books. Overly long, very repetitive. This is overloaded with dead end subplots and boring retreads of stuff already done better in the first two books. I was fine with how everyone ultimately ended up, but it was such a drag to get there. However, I was pleasantly surprised and very glad that (big spoiler about the ending under the tag)  the protagonist's love interest dies at the end both because I thought that was a bold and novel choice and because he was such an annoying character and their relationship was implausible."
35.0,"Another strong installment in the Mistborn series. I thought the plot took a while to get going but once it did it was quite interesting and the characters remain compelling. I loved everything about the villain in this book, a great character with fascinating motivations. I also appreciated all the detail about the difficulties of industrialization in Elendel."
517.0,"Very well-written; excellent character development. In several spots, the extended time spent completing the book (which Johnson refers to in her Acknowledgments) is evident: for example, Facebook no longer has ""walls,"" there are absolutely no public telephones available anywhere in 2017, and my biggest personal complaint,  no teacher, especially not a 23 year old college grad, should need ""cyberbullying"" announced to them as if the term is new or unfamiliar. Overall, an excellent view inside the lives, minds, and hearts of teens today."
290.0,"For this review and more Live Read and Breathe I know some people have said that it was too much sex and not enough story but I have to disagree on that one. Even though there was a LOT of sex I felt like that was part of the story of Bennett and Chloe. Bennett and Chloe were so much alike that created such a hate/love relationship between the two that the only outlet valve was pure hot raw sex. Once that valve was opened they were able to really see each other for what they are and what they mean to each other. I liked the love story part of it and I especially liked the very raw, unhibitied sex scenes between the two."
340.0,"3.5 stars I didn't realize at first that this is an extension of the Dark Protector series, which I did not complete. While most readers would not find this to be a stumbling block, that sort of thing drives me crazy- I always feel haunted by what I'm missing. Aside from that, the story was HOT and fast-paced, with intriguing characters that I enjoyed spending time with. I did feel that at times the hero was (dare I say...) a bit too Neanderthal. Still, a solid start to Zanetti's new series."
657.0,"Really enjoyed this one. It is not as good as the Eona Duology but this first book is obviously meant to set the foundation for the coming 2 books and as such, was slow at times but I didn't even find the slow bits to be tedious or anything of the sort and the story really picks up a fast pace in the last 200 pages or so. I genuinely can't wait to see where Goodman takes this story, it has such great potential. And as usual, the attention to historical detail is astounding. Goodman draws from real historical characters and events and I really admire a well-researched story."
296.0,"I just love these books. To quote Joel: ""This is an excellent wrap-up to Lisbeth's story and the trilogy, leaving exactly one thread hanging, and a small one at that, which is remarkable considerng it's number three in a planned run of 10. It leaves Mikael and Lisbeth in a great place, and pays off pretty much everything that was established over the previous two books. That it does so with a histrionic courtroom scene, all the better. """
227.0,"Despite whatever, I am very affected. I am incredibly sad. I can hear see and witnessed the scenes, and despite it end the way it should, I wish it didn't. I wish there's alternate ending that would let me not see those scenes repeatedly. Oh, and this story is good. The second book was a bit boring, but the whole plot is good."
221.0,"8th&up, 3.5 stars This bittersweet, suspenseful time travel romance should have plenty of appeal for teen readers. Cassie, the modern heroine, shows a lot of character growth as she changes from self-centered whiner to a confident and determined woman. Lawrence, the dreamy young man from the 1920s, goes through changes as well when he realizes that his world has a dark side that he must fight against if he is to stay true to his dreams and his heart. This book was obtained at BEA15 in exchange for an honest review."
31.0,"I really enjoyed this one. 16 y/o Janelle is a caretaker to her family due to a bipolar mother and a workaholic father. Her sense of responsibility is never damped, even when she inexplicably survives being killed in the opening. We all hear how an author has to make life hard for the character, and this book is filled with one tough choice after another. Fans of the ""it all works out"" shiny happy ending will not be satisfied, though the resolution is satisfying."
214.0,"Detective Barry Duckworth doesn't know which way to turn. Recently trouble has haunted Promise Falls, and now a mysterious and deadly illness has spread like wildfire all across the little town. When signs begin to point to a deliberate act of terror, Duckworth wonders if someone has decided that the time has come for the people of Promise Falls to pay for past sins. The Twenty-Three opens with a bang and keeps moving fast and furious throughout. Previous visitors to this creepy little town will be more than satisfied with the twists and turns that Barclay serves up. This book was obtained though NetGalley, with thanks to Berkley Publishing Group, in exchange for an honest review."
507.0,"This story had so much promise! And I love Whitney G. 's writing style; in fact, Turbulence was one of my favorite books this year. This was a cute, fast read BUT several typos later and a heroine who sends sexually explicit emails from her work account and I'm out. Moving on with high hopes for this author's next book. Call me an eternal optimist."
120.0,"I adore this book! If it wasn't for one thing, this book would have been perfect. But nothing bothers me most than when a ""sex scene"" is used wrongly, like when are in a life threatening trouble and they decide to fornicate anyway because the sex tension is unbearable. It just makes me mad. But past that, Alexia is a great character -incredible funny and witty and the right ""sex scenes"" make me giggle Obviously the book is so much more than that, a well paranormal intriguing story with an also great plot full of humor."
64.0,"You know a story is perfectly executed when you have never experienced the kind of life the main character is living, yet you find that you relate to her (or in this case, many of them). Told through various POVs and staying true to its name, this story was ugly, wonderful, and most of all moving."
137.0,"Everyone knows the basics of the true story of Lizzie Borden and the scandalous murder of her father and stepmother, but Sarah Schmidt delves into that event with a chilling and slippery tale that offers new perspective to the old tale. Readers will be drawn down into the madness of the Borden household, and they'll be left wondering about the full truth of the event until the final pages. Thanks to Atlantic/Ingram for providing this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
